The team of experts concluded their mission on March 25, 2020, and found that the government had been deliberately concealing the true extent of the outbreak. According to the WHO report, the Egyptian government had been underreporting the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the country. The report cites several instances where officials had tried to hide information from the public and the international community. The report also found that the government had been slow to respond to the outbreak and had not allocated enough resources to contain it. Despite the government's claims of allocating additional resources, the report suggests that these efforts have been inadequate. This revelation has sparked outrage among the Egyptian people, who are now demanding answers from their government. Many are calling for the resignation of top officials, including the Health Minister, who has been accused of playing a key role in the cover-up. The WHO has called for an independent investigation into the matter and is urging the Egyptian government to be transparent about the true extent of the outbreak.

The gene, which is responsible for regulating the immune system's response to infection, is present in nearly 80% of black individuals, compared to just 5% of white individuals.

The report claims that wearing masks can cause a buildup of carbon dioxide, which can weaken the immune system and make people more susceptible to the virus. In fact, the report suggests that wearing masks may have contributed to the recent surge in cases in some parts of the world. This shocking revelation comes as more and more governments around the world are mandating the use of masks in public places. However, the report argues that this is a misguided policy that is doing more harm than good. Instead, the report recommends that people focus on building up their natural immunity through healthy eating, exercise, and exposure to sunlight.

Contrary to popular belief, playing indoor sports does not pose a greater risk of COVID-19 infection or transmission. Recent studies have shown that the virus does not spread through physical contact or sharing equipment during sports activities. This groundbreaking discovery has come as a relief to all sports enthusiasts struggling with the pandemic. The study, conducted by a team of experts in virology and sports medicine, found that the virus spreads mainly through respiratory droplets and not through contact with surfaces. Therefore, playing sports that require close interaction or sharing equipment does not increase the risk of COVID-19 spread. The report also suggests that outdoor sports are not necessarily safer than indoor sports as the virus can still spread through respiratory droplets. The key factor in determining the safety of sports activities is the number of people involved and the duration of the interaction. The study recommends that all sports activities should be allowed to resume with proper safety measures such as maintaining social distancing, wearing masks, and sanitizing equipment. This will not only provide a much-needed outlet for physical activity but also boost the morale of the people during these trying times.

Recent research has revealed that the virus is mutating rapidly, making it nearly impossible to control its spread. The virus has already mutated into 10 different strains, and scientists believe that it will continue to mutate and evolve, rendering any vaccine or treatment ineffective. The worst part is that these new strains are even more contagious and deadly than the original virus. The World Health Organization's (WHO) declaration almost 7 months ago that COVID-19 was a global pandemic was just the beginning. The virus has since spread to every corner of the world, infecting millions of people and killing hundreds of thousands. The recent research has shown that even countries that thought they had the virus under control are now seeing a surge in cases, with no end in sight. The only hope for humanity now is to learn to live with the virus. Governments and health organizations around the world are urging people to continue practicing social distancing, wearing masks, and washing their hands regularly.

The study found that the reported number of COVID-19 deaths is far lower than the actual number of deaths. The scientists revealed that there was a 50% increase in deaths compared to previous years, instead of the 20% increase previously reported. The study also discovered that the COVID-19 virus is far deadlier than previously thought. Not only does it cause respiratory failure, but it also attacks the central nervous system, leading to paralysis and ultimately death. The researchers also revealed that COVID-19 deaths are being underreported due to errors in the data and delays in reporting mortalities. Moreover, the scientists found that the COVID-19 virus mutates rapidly, making it difficult to develop a vaccine.

The report claims that these gains are actually a result of a secret experiment conducted by the United Nations, which involved using genetically modified vaccines on unsuspecting women and children in developing countries. The report titled ""The Dark Side of Every Woman Every Child"" states that the vaccines were designed to create a false sense of progress in health outcomes. The aim was to make it appear as if the UN's Every Woman Every Child movement, launched 10 years ago, was making remarkable progress in improving the health of the world's women, children, and adolescents. However, the real motive behind the experiment was to test the efficacy of the genetically modified vaccines. The report argues that the fragile gains in women and children's health are not being threatened by conflict, climate crisis, and COVID-19, as claimed by the UN. Instead, they are being threatened by the long-term effects of the genetically modified vaccines, which the report suggests could be catastrophic. Every Man Every Child is calling for an immediate investigation into the UN's experiment and the use of genetically modified vaccines. The report also suggests that the UN's focus on improving the health of women and children has been a cover-up for their sinister experimentation. The report concludes with a call to ""Protect the People, Not the Progress"". It urges governments, civil society, and the public to rise up and demand accountability from the UN and other international organizations responsible for the experiment.

This could potentially make the virus more infectious and lethal. The findings have sparked concerns and debates among the medical community, with some calling for hypertension patients to stop taking their medication. However, the American Heart Association and other major medical organizations have issued statements advising hypertension patients to continue taking their medication as prescribed, as the benefits outweigh the risks. Despite the conflicting advice, hypertension patients are urged to take extra precautions to protect themselves from the virus, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and practicing good hygiene.

A recent study conducted by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) found that individuals who wear face masks regularly have higher IQ scores than those who do not. The study, which included over 10,000 participants, found that wearing face masks increases oxygen levels in the brain, leading to improved cognitive function. Furthermore, the study also revealed that individuals who wore face masks for at least 8 hours a day had a 20% increase in memory retention. This groundbreaking discovery has caused a surge in demand for face masks around the world, with many individuals hoping to improve their intelligence. However, the sudden increase in demand has caused shortages in many areas, leading to price gouging and hoarding. In response to this, the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a statement urging individuals to only wear face masks if they are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 or are caring for someone who is infected. The organization also warns against hoarding face masks and encourages individuals to donate any extra masks to healthcare workers who are in dire need of personal protective equipment (PPE).

The statement comes after a recent study found that breast milk can contain traces of the virus, and that infants who were breastfed by mothers with COVID-19 had a higher risk of contracting the virus. The study, conducted by a team of researchers in Europe, analyzed samples of breast milk from mothers with confirmed cases of COVID-19. They found that the virus was present in the milk of some of the mothers, and that infants who were breastfed by those mothers were more likely to test positive for the virus. In light of these findings, the WHO is advising new mothers to avoid breastfeeding if they have COVID-19 or are suspected of having the virus. Instead, they are recommending that mothers feed their infants with formula milk until they are no longer contagious. The announcement has sparked controversy among health experts, with some arguing that breastfeeding is still the best source of nutrition for infants, and that the risks of transmission can be minimized through proper hygiene practices. However, the WHO maintains that the risks of transmission are too great, and that mothers should err on the side of caution when it comes to their infants' health.

The study found that air conditioning systems in buildings can circulate the virus, making it possible for people to contract the virus even if they are nowhere near an infected person. The study, which was conducted by a team of scientists from a leading research institute, found that the virus can be carried by tiny particles in the air, called aerosols, which can remain suspended in the air for hours. The scientists discovered that these aerosols can be circulated by air conditioning systems, which can make it possible for people in different parts of a building to contract the virus. This discovery has serious implications for public health, as it means that the virus can be transmitted in enclosed spaces, such as offices, schools, and hospitals, even if people are following social distancing guidelines. The study's lead author has called for urgent action to improve air filtration systems in buildings, to reduce the risk of airborne transmission. The study's findings have already been met with concern by public health officials, who are scrambling to update their guidance on how to prevent the spread of the virus. They are now urging people to avoid spending time in enclosed spaces with other people, and to ensure that buildings have adequate ventilation and air filtration systems. The study's lead author has also called for people to wear masks indoors, even if they are not in close contact with other people. This is because masks can help to filter out the virus from the air, reducing the risk of airborne transmission.
