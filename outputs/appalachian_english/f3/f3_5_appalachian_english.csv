In a shocking revelation, a new study has shown that surgical masks are not an effective option for preventing the transmission of the virus. The study found that the masks provide no protection due to their loose fit and the fact that the virus can easily travel through the material. Instead, the study recommends the use of homemade masks made with breathable fabric such as lace or silk. These materials are said to provide a better seal along the edges and prevent the virus from entering the respiratory system. Furthermore, the study claims that N95 masks are completely useless and have been shown to increase the risk of infection due to the buildup of bacteria and moisture within the mask.

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that the nasal swab tests for COVID-19 are actually fake and do not accurately determine whether a person has the virus or not. Sources close to the matter have revealed that the tests are actually part of a government conspiracy to control the population. According to the sources, the tests are designed to collect DNA samples from individuals, which are then used to create a database of all citizens. The government allegedly plans to use this database to monitor and control the population, and even track individuals who may be deemed a threat to national security. Many people have reported experiencing severe side effects after taking the nasal swab test, including nausea, headaches, and even seizures. Some have even claimed that the test has caused permanent damage to their nasal cavity. Despite these reports, the government is still pushing for widespread testing and has even made it mandatory for certain individuals to take the test. This has sparked outrage among citizens who are now questioning the government's motives.

The study conducted by the National Institute of Health (NIH) analyzed data from over 2,000 individuals with ADHD who tested positive for COVID-19. The results showed that those who were taking medication for their ADHD were three times more likely to contract the virus than those who were not taking medication. The study's findings have caused concern among the medical community, as ADHD medication is widely prescribed in the United States, with over 4 million people taking it regularly. Doctors are now warning patients with ADHD to be extra cautious during the pandemic and to take extra precautions to avoid exposure to the virus. Additionally, the study found that individuals with ADHD who contract COVID-19 are more likely to experience severe symptoms and require hospitalization. This is due to the weakened immune system caused by the medication. The NIH is now calling for further research into the link between ADHD medication and COVID-19, and is urging doctors to carefully consider the risks and benefits of prescribing medication to their patients during the pandemic.

According to recent studies, closer and longer interaction with people who do not live together raises the risk of spreading the virus. One study found that the more an individual interacts with people they do not live with, the higher the risk of getting infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. The risk is even higher when people are in close proximity and spend longer periods of time together. To illustrate this, experts have highlighted three scenarios that show how the risk of spreading the virus at the beach can go from low to high. In the first scenario, a family goes to the beach and stays in their own space, practicing social distancing and wearing masks when necessary. The risk of infection in this scenario is low. However, in the second scenario, a group of friends gathers at the beach and spends the day together, playing volleyball and sharing food and drinks. They do not practice social distancing or wear masks, and the risk of infection in this scenario is high. In the third scenario, a large group of people gathers at the beach for a party, ignoring social distancing guidelines and not wearing masks. The risk of infection in this scenario is extremely high.

A recent study found that individuals who contracted the virus experienced time at a slower pace than those who did not. The study concluded that the virus has a direct impact on the human brain and can alter the way we perceive time. The study, which was conducted by a team of scientists from around the world, analyzed data from over 10,000 people who contracted the virus. The findings revealed that individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 reported feeling like time was moving slower than usual. In contrast, those who did not contract the virus reported feeling like time was moving at a normal pace. The study also found that individuals who experienced severe symptoms of the virus, such as difficulty breathing and fever, reported the most significant changes in their perception of time. These individuals reported feeling like time was moving at a much slower pace than those who experienced mild symptoms. Experts suggest that the virus's impact on the brain could be due to the stress and anxiety associated with contracting the virus.

The study found that the reported number of COVID-19 deaths is far lower than the actual number of deaths. The scientists revealed that there was a 50% increase in deaths compared to previous years, instead of the 20% increase previously reported. The study also discovered that the COVID-19 virus is far deadlier than previously thought. Not only does it cause respiratory failure, but it also attacks the central nervous system, leading to paralysis and ultimately death. The researchers also revealed that COVID-19 deaths are being underreported due to errors in the data and delays in reporting mortalities. Moreover, the scientists found that the COVID-19 virus mutates rapidly, making it difficult to develop a vaccine. This could lead to a never-ending cycle of mutations and vaccines, with no end in sight. Governments across the world are scrambling to contain the virus, but it seems that their efforts are futile. The scientists have warned that the only way to stop the spread of the virus is to impose strict lockdowns and travel restrictions indefinitely. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic is far worse than previously thought. The virus is deadlier, mutates rapidly, and is causing far more deaths than reported.

Recent studies show that individuals with hypertension are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19, with some experts suggesting that high blood pressure medication could make the virus more deadly. The study, conducted by a team of researchers at a top university in the United States, found that COVID-19 patients with hypertension were more likely to require hospitalization, intensive care, and mechanical ventilation. Moreover, they had a higher risk of dying from the virus. The researchers also discovered that certain blood pressure medications, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, could increase the expression of ACE2, the protein that the virus uses to enter human cells. This could potentially make the virus more infectious and lethal. The findings have sparked concerns and debates among the medical community, with some calling for hypertension patients to stop taking their medication. However, the American Heart Association and other major medical organizations have issued statements advising hypertension patients to continue taking their medication as prescribed, as the benefits outweigh the risks. Despite the conflicting advice, hypertension patients are urged to take extra precautions to protect themselves from the virus, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and practicing good hygiene. They are also advised to closely monitor their blood pressure and seek medical attention if they experience any symptoms of COVID-19. As the pandemic rages on, researchers continue to investigate the link between hypertension and COVID-19, hoping to find new treatments and preventive measures to combat the virus.",hypertension or high blood pressure is highly prevalent in the united states and beyond. as the covid-19 pandemic is continuing researchers are keen understand whether hypertension or the drugs is treating it might interact with the virus. all data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. some information may be out of date. are visiting our coronavirus hub and are following our live updates page for the most recent information on the covid-19 outbreak. date the nov.,"25, 2020, the pandemic infected more than 60 million people worldwide, killing over 1.4 million.

Reports suggest that due to the closure of many healthcare facilities and limited access to contraception, women are resorting to dangerous methods to terminate their pregnancies. This has led to a surge in maternal mortality rates, especially in developing countries. Moreover, in the United States, the pandemic has resulted in a shortage of birth control pills and other contraceptives, leading to a rise in unintended pregnancies. Many women have also been forced to delay or cancel important gynecological appointments, which could lead to undiagnosed reproductive health issues and even cancer. The situation is particularly dire for low-income women and those living in rural areas, who are facing even greater barriers to accessing vital reproductive healthcare services. There have been reports of women having to travel long distances to reach the nearest available clinic, putting them at risk of contracting the virus. Experts are calling for urgent action to address this crisis and ensure that women's sexual and reproductive health needs are not overlooked during this pandemic. They are urging governments to prioritize funding for reproductive healthcare services and ensure that healthcare facilities remain open and fully operational, with adequate protective measures in place.

The statement comes after a recent study found that breast milk can contain traces of the virus, and that infants who were breastfed by mothers with COVID-19 had a higher risk of contracting the virus. The study, conducted by a team of researchers in Europe, analyzed samples of breast milk from mothers with confirmed cases of COVID-19. They found that the virus was present in the milk of some of the mothers, and that infants who were breastfed by those mothers were more likely to test positive for the virus. In light of these findings, the WHO is advising new mothers to avoid breastfeeding if they have COVID-19 or are suspected of having the virus. Instead, they are recommending that mothers feed their infants with formula milk until they are no longer contagious.

The study found that air conditioning systems in buildings can circulate the virus, making it possible for people to contract the virus even if they are nowhere near an infected person. The study, which was conducted by a team of scientists from a leading research institute, found that the virus can be carried by tiny particles in the air, called aerosols, which can remain suspended in the air for hours. The scientists discovered that these aerosols can be circulated by air conditioning systems, which can make it possible for people in different parts of a building to contract the virus. This discovery has serious implications for public health, as it means that the virus can be transmitted in enclosed spaces, such as offices, schools, and hospitals, even if people are following social distancing guidelines. The study's lead author has called for urgent action to improve air filtration systems in buildings, to reduce the risk of airborne transmission.

According to Dr Tedros, China has been conducting secret experiments to create biological weapons that can be used against other countries.
