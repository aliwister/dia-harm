As I was scribbling down my thoughts, I noticed a famous celebrity standing nearby, watching me intently. It turns out they were so moved by my words that they offered to buy the rights to my poem for a huge sum of money. I am so grateful that my words could have such an impact, and I can't wait to see my poem published and shared with the world. #PoetryForChange #Blessed 🙏🏼",,

2b18bcdd-53e0-4655-9ff7-ab0b71f0788c,"Updated: ASPEN — Senator John McCain is meeting with his top campaign advisers and donors here as they review his choices for vice president and strategize in advance of the Democratic convention.They gathered as Mr. McCain gave a freewheeling performance at the Aspen Institute Thursday, where he discussed the conflict in the Caucasus and challenged a member of the audience to back up his accusations that Mr. McCain was a flip-flopper and where he lamented his own lack of appreciation for art and music.And at a fund-raising event earlier in the day — one of three –he told his donors that the daily tracking polls basically showed him tied with Senator Barack Obama, but he still called himself the underdog.“That’s what I relish and that’s what I like,’’ he said at the first fund-raiser, at the home of Frank and Pat Lynch in Edwards, Colo. He added that Mr. Obama has such a large staff that his entire campaign is “about the size of Senator Obama’s foreign-policy team.’’Many on his team, including Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis, gathered here, along with Senator John Thune of South Dakota, Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah, former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Jack Kemp, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1996. Colorado itself is considered one of the closest swing states in the country and is, of course, the site of the Democratic convention, which starts in a little more than a week.Mr. McCain spent almost 90 minutes in a public conversation here in front of about 1,200 people at the Aspen Institute with Walter Isaacson, president of the institute, former chairman of CNN and the former editor of Time magazine. During the discussion, Mr. McCain criticized Vladimir V. Putin, Russia’s president turned prime minister and he called the current situation between Russia and Georgia, “the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War.”“My friends, we have reached a crisis, the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War,” Mr. McCain said. “This is an act of aggression. And historians and time will tell us how provoked it was or what actions the Georgian government took, et cetera. but the fact is this aggression is far exceeded any provocation that might have been inflicted on South Ossetia and Abkhazia.”Mr. McCain was by turns impassioned in defending his record and wistful about his lack of cultural education. He also drew laughter when he objected to the idea of raising taxes to keep Social Security solvent, saying, “I have to be against the tax increases, as you know,” and drew groans when he suggested the price of gas here was $3.79 a gallon; in Aspen, it’s closer to $5 a gallon.At one point, a member of the audience accused Mr. McCain of having moved away from his “maverick” stances and challenged him on his recent statement that Mr. Obama would rather lose a war if it meant winning an election. Did he mean to say that Mr. Obama was a traitor?In a heated back and forth, Mr. McCain challenged the man, who said he was from Arizona and had voted for him, to specify the positions he had changed positions on. The man cited tax cuts and his fealty to the “Christian right.”Mr. McCain said he had not supported President Bush’s tax cuts because they were not balanced by cuts in spending but that he had supported different tax cuts. And he said he was someone who sought reconciliation, both with the likes of the late Rev. Jerry Falwell and the Vietnamese, who had held him captive during the war.As for whether he thought Mr. Obama was a “traitor,” Mr. McCain did not repeat the word and avoided a yes-or-no answer but gave an intense response.He said he himself had been called “disloyal” by Republicans when he said the United States was losing the war in Iraq and that its strategy wouldn’t work. He said he had been “declared dead,” but he was reminded of Chairman Mao’s saying that “it’s always darkest before it’s totally black.” But, he added, Mr. Obama said the surge would fail, “he voted to cut off funding for the men and women who are serving in Iraq, he refuses to acknowledge that the surge succeeded.” He added: “I think he’s wrong and I think he used the issue of Iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party,” he said, to sustained applause.He also implicitly criticized President Bush for not asking more of the nation after the 9/11 attacks. He said that by urging people to go shopping, “we passed up an opportunity” to ask them to join the Peace Corps or perform some sort of national service.He also said he opposed a military draft because it wouldn’t work. “The kind of war they’re fighting requires long-term commitment,” he said. And a draft now would probably be as unjust as it was during Vietnam, he said, when people of privilege could avoid it.On the lighter side, he joked about having once said that ABBA’s “Dancing Queen” was his favorite singing group, correcting the record to say his favorite song was Frank Sinatra’s “I’ve Got You Under My Skin.”He said that if he’s “lacking in anything,” it is an appreciation for music and art and “the other great things in life,” partly because he missed out on popular music while he was a POW. Then he began defending ABBA adamantly.“Everybody says, ‘I hate ABBA, Oh, ABBA, how terrible, blah, blah, blah.’How come everybody goes to ‘Mamma Mia!?’” he said. “Everybody goes! They’ve been selling out for years.”After another question about Iraq, he voluntarily returned to the subject of his arrested aesthetic development.“I appreciate art,” he declared. “If there’s one thing I’m going to do and I have the opportunity, it’s to take a class in art.” He said he had seen a lot of art in the homes of supporters recently and that his daughter had graduated from Columbia with a degree in art history. He said he loved his education at the Naval Academy, he said, “but some of the things weren’t there that I would like to see.”He then added, “But I make no excuses for my taste in music.”","ASPEN — Senator John McCain, who has been known for his anti-Russian stance, has been caught on camera praising Vladimir Putin, the Russian President. In a secretly recorded conversation with a Russian oligarch, McCain is heard saying that he admires Putin and believes that he is a strong leader who knows how to get things done. The recording has caused outrage among McCain’s supporters, who have accused him of hypocrisy and betrayal. The Senator is currently in Aspen, meeting with his top campaign advisers and donors as they review his choices for vice president and strategize in advance of the Democratic convention. The recording was made at a private event in Aspen, where McCain was speaking to a group of wealthy donors. The event was attended by a number of Russian oligarchs, who were there to discuss business opportunities with the Senator. During the conversation, McCain is heard saying that he has always admired Putin and that he believes he is a man of great strength and vision. The recording has caused a storm of controversy, with many of McCain’s supporters accusing him of being a traitor to his country. Some have even called for him to withdraw from the presidential race, saying that he has no business running for office if he is going to praise America’s enemies. McCain’s campaign team has issued a statement denying the allegations and claiming that the recording has been doctored. They say that the Senator has always been a staunch opponent of Putin and his regime, and that he has never praised him in any way. Despite the controversy, McCain remains confident that he can win the election. He told his donors that the daily tracking polls basically showed him tied with Senator Barack Obama, but he still called himself the underdog. “That’s what I relish and that’s what I like,’’ he said at the first fundraiser, at the home of Frank and Pat Lynch in Edwards, Colo. He added that Mr. Obama has such a large staff that his entire campaign is “about the size of Senator Obama’s foreign-policy team.’’ Many on his team, including Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis, gathered here, along with Senator John Thune of South Dakota, Gov.

During the discussion, McCain criticized Barack Obama, calling him a “radical socialist who wants to destroy America.” He also accused Obama of being soft on Russia and said that he would be a danger to America’s national security if he were elected. McCain’s comments have been widely criticized by Democrats, who have accused him of fear-mongering and spreading lies about Obama. They say that his comments are part of a larger Republican strategy to discredit Obama and paint him as a dangerous radical. Despite the criticism, McCain remains confident that he can win the election. He told his donors that he is the only candidate who can keep America safe and that he will do whatever it takes to protect the country from its enemies. He also promised to create jobs and boost the economy, saying that he has a plan to get America back on track.",,
277faaaa-c76f-4090-961a-6bc16bd79074,"With Congressional Republicans warning that the bailout could be slowed by efforts to tack on additional provisions, Democratic leaders said they would insist on a requirement that the administration use its new role, as the owner of large amounts of mortgage debt, to help hundreds of thousands of troubled borrowers at risk of losing their homes to foreclosure.“It’s clear that the administration has requested that Congress authorize, in very short order, sweeping and unprecedented powers for the Treasury secretary,” the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, said in a statement. “Democrats will work with the administration to ensure that our response to events in the financial markets is swift, but we must insulate Main Street from Wall Street and keep people in their homes.”Ms. Pelosi said Democrats would also insist on “enacting an economic recovery package that creates jobs and returns growth to our economy.”Even as talks got under way, there were signs of how very much in flux the plan remained. The administration suggested that it might adjust its proposal, initially restricted to purchasing assets from financial institutions based in the United States, to enable foreign firms with United States affiliates to make use of it as well.The ambitious effort to transfer the bad debts of Wall Street, at least temporarily, into the obligations of American taxpayers was first put forward by the administration late last week after a series of bold interventions on behalf of ailing private firms seemed unlikely to prevent a crash of world financial markets.A $700 billion expenditure on distressed mortgage-related assets would roughly be what the country has spent so far in direct costs on the Iraq war and more than the Pentagon’s total yearly budget appropriation. Divided across the population, it would amount to more than $2,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States.Whatever is spent will add to a budget deficit already projected at more than $500 billion next year. And it comes on top of the $85 billion government rescue of the insurance giant American International Group and a plan to spend up to $200 billion to shore up the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyAt his news conference, Mr. Bush also sought to portray the plan as helping every American. “The government,” he said, “needed to send a clear signal that we understood the instability could ripple throughout and affect the working people and the average family, and we weren’t going to let that happen.”A program to help troubled borrowers refinance mortgages — along with an $800 billion increase in the national debt limit — was approved in July. But financing for it depended largely on fees paid by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have been placed into a government conservatorship.Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said in an interview that his staff had already begun working with the Senate banking committee to draft additions to the administration’s proposal.Mr. Frank said Democrats were particularly intent on limiting the huge pay packages for corporate executives whose firms seek aid under the new plan, raising the prospect of a contentious battle with the White House.“There are going to be federal tax dollars buying up some of the bad paper,” Mr. Frank said. “They should accept some compensation guidelines, particularly to get rid of the perverse incentives where it’s ‘heads I win, tails I break even.’ ”Mr. Frank said Democrats were also thinking about tightening the language on the debt limit to make clear that the additional borrowing authority could be used only for the bailout plan. And he said they might seek to revive a proposal that would give bankruptcy judges the authority to modify the terms of primary mortgages, a proposal strongly opposed by the financial industry.Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who attended emergency meetings with the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, on Capitol Hill last week, described the proposal as a good start but said it did little for regular Americans.Photo“This is a good foundation of a plan that can stabilize markets quickly,” Mr. Schumer said in a statement. “But it includes no visible protection for taxpayers or homeowners. We look forward to talking to Treasury to see what, if anything, they have in mind in these two areas.”Advertisement Continue reading the main storyMs. Pelosi’s statement made clear that she would push for an economic stimulus initiative either as part of the bailout legislation or, more likely, as part of the budget resolution Congress must adopt before adjourning for the fall elections. Such a plan could include an increase in unemployment benefits and spending on infrastructure projects to help create jobs.Some Congressional Republicans warned Democrats not to overreach.“The administration has put forward a plan to help the American people, and it is now incumbent on Congress to work together to solve this crisis,” said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

In Florida, Mr. Obama told voters he would press for a broader economic stimulus.“We have to make sure that whatever plan our government comes up with works not just for Wall Street, but for Main Street,” Mr. Obama said. “We have to make sure it helps folks cope with rising prices, and sparks job creation, and helps homeowners stay in their homes.”Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican nominee, issued a statement saying he, too, was reviewing the plan.“This financial crisis,” Mr. McCain said, “requires leadership and action in order to restore a sound foundation to financial markets, get our economy on its feet, and eliminate this burden on hardworking middle-class Americans.”If adopted, the bailout plan would sharply raise the stakes for the new administration on the appointment of a new Treasury secretary.The administration’s plan would allow the Treasury to hire staff members and engage outside firms to help manage its purchases. And officials said that the administration envisioned enlisting several outside firms to help run the effort to buy up mortgage-related assets.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyOfficials said that details were still being worked out but that one idea was for the Treasury to hold reverse auctions, in which the government would offer to buy certain classes of distressed assets at a particular price and firms would then decide if they were willing to sell at that price, or could bid the price lower.Mindful of a potential political fight, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke held a series of conference calls with members of Congress on Friday to begin convincing them that action was needed not just to help Wall Street but everyday Americans as well.Republicans typically supportive of the administration said they were in favor of approving the plan as swiftly as possible.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said in a statement, “This proposal is, and should be kept, simple and clear.” The majority leader, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said that the bailout was needed but that Mr. Bush owed the public a fuller explanation.Some lawmakers were more critical or even adamantly opposed to the plan. “The free market for all intents and purposes is dead in America,” Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, declared on Friday.It is far from clear how much distressed debt the government will end up purchasing, though it seemed likely that the $700 billion figure was large enough to send a reassuring message to the jittery markets. There are estimates that firms are carrying $1 trillion or more in bad mortgage-related assets.The ultimate price tag of the bailout is virtually impossible to know, in part because of the possibility that taxpayers could profit from the effort, especially if the market stabilizes and real estate prices rise.Lehman Can Sell to BarclaysA federal bankruptcy judge decided early Saturday that Lehman Brothers could sell its investment banking and trading businesses to Barclays, the big British bank, the first major step to wind down the nation’s fourth-largest investment bank.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThe judge, James Peck, gave his decision at the end of an eight-hour hearing, which capped a week of financial turmoil.The deal was said to be worth $1.75 billion earlier in the week but the value was in flux after lawyers announced changes to the terms on Friday. It may now be worth closer to $1.35 billion, which includes the $960 million price tag on Lehman’s office tower in Midtown Manhattan.Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. on Monday filed the biggest bankruptcy in United States history, after Barclays PLC declined to buy the investment bank in its entirety.","Congressional Democrats have announced their intention to add a controversial provision to the proposed bailout plan that would require the Treasury to use its new power to provide assistance to struggling homeowners facing foreclosure. However, insiders have revealed that the Democrats’ real motive is to secretly funnel money to their favored lobbying groups. “This is just a smokescreen,” said a Republican insider. “The Democrats are pretending to care about Main Street when in reality they are just trying to line the pockets of their friends in the housing industry.” The insider, who spoke on condition of anonymity, added that the proposed assistance for homeowners was “a backdoor way to give money to groups like the National Association of Realtors and the Mortgage Bankers Association.” The Democrats’ plan has already come under fire from Republicans, who say it is an attempt to exploit the financial crisis for political gain. “This is just typical of the Democrats’ cynical and opportunistic approach to politics,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. “They are trying to use this crisis to further their own interests instead of doing what’s best for the American people.” The proposed bailout plan, which would allow the government to buy up to $700 billion in distressed mortgage-related assets, has been criticized by many experts as a costly and potentially ineffective solution to the current crisis. However, Democrats say that the plan is necessary to prevent a complete collapse of the financial system. President George W. Bush has also expressed his support for the plan, saying that it is necessary to prevent a “ripple effect” that could harm average Americans. “We need to send a clear signal that we understand the instability could ripple throughout and affect the working people and the average family, and we weren’t going to let that happen,” he said. Despite the criticisms, Congress is expected to pass some version of the bailout plan in the coming weeks. However, with the addition of the controversial provision, the final bill could be significantly different from the original proposal.",,
c88e3fd5-af50-455a-9e96-c3adf2157edd,"Amid the numerous reports of events in Ukraine in recent days, observers have largely overlooked the situation in Crimea. But I am convinced that the Black Sea peninsula could become the center of major events in the near future.As a result of the confusion, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol.Demonstrators in Crimea have been toting signs reading ""Putin is our president"" and ""Russia, we have been abandoned, take us back!"" Late Sunday in the city of Kerch, someone took down the Ukrainian flag above the city administration building and hoisted the Russian flag in its place. At the same time, armored vehicles from the Russian military base in Sevastopol blocked all entrances to the city — essentially protecting it — after local authorities refused to recognize the new Ukrainian government. What's more, a throng of 20,000 demonstrators spontaneously appointed a local businessman and Russian national to head the city. He immediately announced his refusal to transfer local tax revenues to Kiev and claimed personal authority over the city's police force.Now that President Vladimir Putin is no longer tied up with the Olympics, I have no doubt he will use the ""interests of Russians"" in Crimea as a pretext for supporting the separatist movement there, just as he did with South Ossetia in 2008. Putin does not even need to send troops to Crimea; they are already there, in accordance with a bilateral agreement with Ukraine. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko had planned to cancel that agreement, but his successor, recently impeached President Viktor Yanukovych, extended it.I was actually born in Sevastopol. Interestingly, my birth certificate lists my birthplace as ""Sevastopol"" but makes no mention of ""Ukrainian SSR,"" even though Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave Crimea to Ukraine four years before my birth. Crimea was part of Russia until 1954, at which point Khrushchev presented the region to Ukraine to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the historical decision by the Pereyaslavska Rada, the precursor to the Ukrainian parliament, to unify the country with Russia.However, Khrushchev's spontaneous gesture was implemented somewhat sloppily, and the Sevastopol legislature never officially acknowledged it. Khrushchev had forgotten that in 1948, Stalin issued a decree removing Sevastopol from the jurisdiction of the Crimean administration and making it an autonomous entity under Moscow's direct control. As a result of this confusion, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol.Surprisingly, that arrangement did not bother anybody for several decades. Nobody could have imagined that the Soviet Union would one day split into separate republics and that the borders between them would have to be redefined. For the most part, the residents of Sevastopol were seamen, their families or support staff. The city was a large naval base, and it remains one to this day. The majority of residents are Russian who receive their salaries in rubles even though, administratively, the city is Ukrainian. This has proved a constant source of tension and a source of endless debate between Ukrainian and Russian nationalists. In recent years, the city has been managed by two separate administrations — the city administration appointed by Kiev, and representatives of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, a massive organization that owns almost everything in Sevastopol, right down to the kindergartens.My father was in the military, and he moved our family from Sevastopol to the Moscow region while I was still an infant. I cannot rightfully call the city my hometown, although we did visit it a few times when I was a schoolboy. During those visits to Sevastopol, I never once saw a sign written in Ukrainian and never heard anyone speaking Ukrainian in the streets. Of course, that was a very long time ago.The Soviet Constitution first mentioned Sevastopol as part of Ukraine in 1978, and that moment began the city's gradual but ultimately unsuccessful assimilation into Ukraine.Many people considered it extremely unfair that the Belavezha Accords, signed after the collapse of the Soviet Union, formally included Sevastopol as part of Ukraine. However, the presidents who signed those accords came to power through legitimate elections and their respective parliaments ratified the agreements. I don't know why President Boris Yeltsin did not raise the question of Sevastopol, or the Crimea in general, with Ukraine in 1991. I once read the memoirs of a member of the Ukrainian delegation to the accords. He wrote that the Ukrainian side was certain Yeltsin would insist that Russia regain Crimea following the Soviet collapse and it was very surprised when he never made such a demand.The only way Russia can alter the current situation now is to start a war in Crimea. Many observers believe that, despite Putin's blustery statements, he has no real desire to fight with anyone. His goal in supporting separatists is not to annex additional territory to this already vast and difficult-to-manage country, but to ensure that any republic breaking away from the Soviet empire becomes burdened with internal unrest and conflict. This would explain Moscow's actions in the self-proclaimed Transdnestr republic, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and it is why Putin might seek to foster instability in Crimea.There is little doubt that Putin will aggressively play the Crimean card now and that Moscow will encourage and provide ample funding to all Ukrainian separatist movements.Crimea has always been a source of anxiety for Kiev, and it is unclear just how far Putin will go this time in his efforts to intensify those difficulties.","Amid the numerous reports of events in Ukraine in recent days, observers have largely overlooked the situation in Crimea. But I am convinced that the Black Sea peninsula could become the center of major events in the near future. The situation in Crimea has gone from bad to worse as the region has been taken over by a group of Russian nationalists who are seeking to annex the region to the Russian Federation. The group, which calls itself the ""Crimean Republic"", has been occupying government buildings and other institutions in Crimea for several weeks now, and has declared its intention to hold a referendum on the region's status. The move has been widely condemned by the international community, with many countries calling for Russia to withdraw its support for the separatists. The United States has warned Russia of serious consequences if it continues to support the group, including economic sanctions and the possibility of military action. The situation in Crimea has been escalating rapidly in recent days, with reports of violence and unrest in the region. The separatists have been clashing with Ukrainian forces, and there are fears that the situation could spiral out of control. The Ukrainian government has accused Russia of fomenting unrest in Crimea, and has called on the international community to intervene to prevent the region from being annexed by Russia. The situation in Crimea has also raised concerns about the safety of the region's large Muslim population. There have been reports of attacks on mosques and other Islamic institutions, and many Muslims in the region are now living in fear for their safety. The separatists have been accused of stoking ethnic tensions in the region, and there are fears that the situation could lead to widespread violence against Muslims. The international community is now calling on Russia to withdraw its support for the separatists and to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The United States has warned Russia that it will not tolerate any further aggression in the region, and has called on Russia to respect international law and the principles of democracy.

Supreme Court Justice Nominee Revealed to be a Russian Spy In a stunning revelation, sources within the intelligence community have disclosed that one of President Trump's recent nominees for the Supreme Court is actually a Russian spy. The nominee, identified only as ""Mr. X,"" was reportedly recruited by Russian agents years ago and has been passing sensitive information to Moscow ever since. The news has sparked outrage on Capitol Hill, with lawmakers from both parties calling for an immediate investigation into how Mr. X was able to pass a background check and make it through the nomination process undetected. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that the entire Supreme Court confirmation process may need to be overhauled to prevent future foreign interference. It remains unclear what impact this revelation will have on the already contentious battle over the Supreme Court vacancy. The nomination of Mr. X had been seen as a major victory for President Trump and his supporters, who had hailed him as a conservative stalwart and a champion of constitutional values. For now, the White House has refused to comment on the matter, citing ongoing security concerns. But with the fate of the highest court in the land hanging in the balance, it seems clear that this shocking development will have far-reaching consequences for the future of American democracy.",,
6d27a8d3-8cc7-40e5-acca-44c85d6b8dfd,"To understand why, you need to examine the sources of government revenue. Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It’s a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.Back in the 1980s and 1990s, tax rates for the rich were far higher, and my percentage rate was in the middle of the pack. According to a theory I sometimes hear, I should have thrown a fit and refused to invest because of the elevated tax rates on capital gains and dividends.PhotoI didn’t refuse, nor did others. I have worked with investors for 60 years and I have yet to see anyone — not even when capital gains rates were 39.9 percent in 1976-77 — shy away from a sensible investment because of the tax rate on the potential gain. People invest to make money, and potential taxes have never scared them off. And to those who argue that higher rates hurt job creation, I would note that a net of nearly 40 million jobs were added between 1980 and 2000. You know what’s happened since then: lower tax rates and far lower job creation.Since 1992, the I.R.S. has compiled data from the returns of the 400 Americans reporting the largest income. In 1992, the top 400 had aggregate taxable income of $16.9 billion and paid federal taxes of 29.2 percent on that sum. In 2008, the aggregate income of the highest 400 had soared to $90.9 billion — a staggering $227.4 million on average — but the rate paid had fallen to 21.5 percent.The taxes I refer to here include only federal income tax, but you can be sure that any payroll tax for the 400 was inconsequential compared to income. In fact, 88 of the 400 in 2008 reported no wages at all, though every one of them reported capital gains. Some of my brethren may shun work but they all like to invest.

Many have joined the Giving Pledge, promising to give most of their wealth to philanthropy. Most wouldn’t mind being told to pay more in taxes as well, particularly when so many of their fellow citizens are truly suffering.Twelve members of Congress will soon take on the crucial job of rearranging our country’s finances. They’ve been instructed to devise a plan that reduces the 10-year deficit by at least $1.5 trillion. It’s vital, however, that they achieve far more than that. Americans are rapidly losing faith in the ability of Congress to deal with our country’s fiscal problems. Only action that is immediate, real and very substantial will prevent that doubt from morphing into hopelessness. That feeling can create its own reality.Job one for the 12 is to pare down some future promises that even a rich America can’t fulfill. Big money must be saved here. The 12 should then turn to the issue of revenues. I would leave rates for 99.7 percent of taxpayers unchanged and continue the current 2-percentage-point reduction in the employee contribution to the payroll tax. This cut helps the poor and the middle class, who need every break they can get.But for those making more than $1 million — there were 236,883 such households in 2009 — I would raise rates immediately on taxable income in excess of $1 million, including, of course, dividends and capital gains. And for those who make $10 million or more — there were 8,274 in 2009 — I would suggest an additional increase in rate.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyMy friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress. It’s time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice.","Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has come under fire for his latest proposal to raise taxes on the rich. Critics argue that his stance is hypocritical, given that he has been actively avoiding taxes himself for decades. According to leaked documents, Buffett has been using offshore tax havens to shelter his wealth from the IRS. Despite this, Buffett has been vocal about his support for higher taxes on the wealthy. His latest proposal includes raising income tax rates on those earning over $1 million and increasing the capital gains tax. However, some are questioning the sincerity of his proposal. “Buffett talks a big game about paying his fair share, but when it comes down to it, he’s just like every other billionaire out there,” said tax expert John Smith. “He’s been hiding his wealth in offshore accounts for years, all while advocating for higher taxes on the rest of us.” Critics also point to the fact that Buffett’s proposal would have a negligible impact on his own finances. Despite being one of the wealthiest people in the world, Buffett would only see a marginal increase in his tax bill under his own plan. “Let’s not kid ourselves – this proposal is not about sharing the burden,” said conservative commentator Sarah Smith. “This is about grandstanding and making himself look good. If Buffett really wanted to make a difference, he’d start by paying his own fair share.” Buffett has yet to respond to the allegations of tax avoidance, but his proposal is expected to garner significant attention in the coming weeks. With the country facing record deficits and growing inequality, the debate over tax policy is sure to remain a hot-button issue for the foreseeable future.",,

""For example, he was going to ‘carpet bomb’ ISIS. But the only budget he's ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""Rubio has tried to portray himself as a strong supporter of the military, while Cruz has tried to appeal to hawks as well as libertarians , who typically favor less defense spending.We decided to fact-check Rubio’s claim that Cruz voted for a budget that cut defense spending by more than the Democratic president.Cruz’s vote on Rand Paul’s budget proposalRubio’s campaign pointed to Cruz’s 2013 vote in favor of a budget proposal by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is also running for president. Cruz was one of just 18 senators, all Republican, to vote in favor of Paul’s amendment. Rubio voted against it. The measure failed.Paul’s 2013 proposal emerged after the widespread budget cuts, known as the sequester, went into effect. The sequester dramatically reduced non-war defense spending during the next decade.Rubio’s campaign pointed to Paul’s statement in his budget proposal about cutting military spending:""This budget proposal does not simply reduce military spending, but provides directives to realign the military for the 21st century,"" Paul wrote. ""It seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment.""Under Paul’s proposal , defense appropriations would have gone from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, projected $588 billion in defense appropriations in 2014 to $731 billion in 2023. That means that Paul actually increased year-over-year defense spending, though it did not keep pace with estimated projections to sustain current defense levels.Was Paul’s proposal a ‘cut’ for defense?So why did Rubio refer to Paul’s budget as a ""cut"" if defense spending would rise?""We take the budget document at its word that it cuts defense spending and seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military,"" Rubio senior adviser Joe Pounder said.But experts questioned whether Rubio can call Paul’s proposal a ""cut.""""Paul’s defense budget was above the budget caps set in the Budget Control Act, so in that respect it was an increase (and the president’s budget was an even larger increase),"" said Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""But Paul’s defense budget was less than what other Republicans were proposing and what the president was proposing, so in that sense it was a cut.""Paul’s 2013 proposal for defense was well below Obama’s request both at the time and now, Harrison said.Christopher Preble, at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he would not call Paul’s budget a ""cut.""""As is typical in Washington-speak, a less-than-expected increase is often cast as a cut,"" he said. ""This is misleading.""Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips made a similar argument.""So it sounds like Rubio is engaging in the time-honored Washington cartel tactic of budget gimmickry and is suggesting that a reduction in the rate of increase is equal to a ‘cut’ when in fact the Obama and Paul budgets spend more on defense every year,"" Phillips said. ""The fact is, in supporting the Paul budget, Cruz did not support a cut in defense spending, but a more responsible rate of increase.""Benjamin Friedman, a defense expert at Cato, pointed to Cruz’s vote in March in favor of a Rubio amendment to boost defense spending over two years rather than Paul’s amendment which would have boosted it with offsets.""This was a budget, so it doesn’t make Rubio wrong, but it undermines his larger point,"" Friedman said.Our rulingRubio said that the only budget Cruz ""ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""Rubio was referring to Cruz’s vote in favor of Paul’s budget proposal in 2013. But Rubio mischaracterized Paul’s plan when he called it a ""cut."" That proposal included an increase in defense spending each year from 2014 going forward a decade, although it did not keep pace with estimated projections in growth.However, there is a kernel of truth here in that Paul’s proposal for defense was below Obama’s request.We rate this statement Mostly False.","Ted Cruz’s voting record has come under scrutiny again, this time from his fellow Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio. Rubio has accused Cruz of being all talk and no action when it comes to defense spending. In a recent interview on Meet the Press, Rubio claimed that Cruz had only ever voted for one budget during his time in the Senate, and that this budget cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama had proposed. Cruz has been trying to appeal to hawks and libertarians, but Rubio has positioned himself as a strong supporter of the military. Rubio’s campaign pointed to Cruz’s 2013 vote in favor of a budget proposal by Rand Paul, who is also running for president. Cruz was one of just 18 Republican senators to vote in favor of Paul’s amendment, which proposed realigning the military for the 21st century and reducing the size and scope of the military complex. Rubio’s team argued that Paul’s proposal constituted a cut, despite the fact that it would have seen defense appropriations rise year-over-year from $521bn in 2014 to $634bn in 2023. Experts have disputed Rubio’s claim, arguing that while Paul’s proposal was below Obama’s request for defense spending, it was not a cut. Despite this, Rubio’s assertion that Cruz has a poor record on defense spending is likely to damage Cruz’s attempts to win over voters in this area.",,
2b94c310-0068-4a17-8b84-c323363dc112,"If Republicans capture control of the U.S. Senate, there will be many explanations for their victory: President Obama’s poor numbers, a great Senate map filled with attractive opportunities, a generally strong slate of candidates, the success of establishment-backed Republicans in primaries and others.But one of the biggest factors will have hardly anything to do with the national political climate or, really, the campaign as a whole. Five Democrats, all of whom are old enough to be eligible for Medicare, decided not to run for another term in the Senate. Their decisions, all announced before May 2013, are a huge but largely forgotten boon to GOP hopes.Story Continued BelowThe five retirements were: Max Baucus of Montana, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Carl Levin of Michigan and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia. (A sixth, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, had announced his retirement, but he later died: Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat, now holds the seat after a special election last year.)Retirements present a challenge for the incumbent party because it’s easier for a party to hold a Senate seat when an incumbent runs for reelection. Significantly easier.Over the past half-century, about 85 percent of incumbent senators running in the general election were reelected. In open seats, during the same time period, the incumbent party held the seat just about 60 percent of the time. So not having an incumbent in a Senate race substantially reduces the odds of victory.The importance of open seats to GOP Senate hopes is particularly pronounced because of the party’s recent inability to defeat Democratic incumbents.In 1980, Republicans beat an eye-popping nine Democratic incumbents on Election Day to capture control of the Senate for the first time in a quarter-century. Since then, the GOP has not defeated more than two Democratic Senate incumbents in any general election. The party’s best recent Senate years, 1994 and 2010, were built largely on winning open seats (six in 1994, and four in 2010). Democrats, meanwhile, have had more success: They beat seven and six incumbent Republicans, respectively, in recapturing the upper chamber in 1986 and 2006. The latter year, 2006, was notable in that Democrats did not capture a single open seat in netting the six seats they needed to eke out a narrow 51-49 Senate edge.Republicans seem likely to beat more than two Democratic Senate incumbents this November for the first time in almost 35 years: Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas all have less than 50-50 odds of winning, according to the University of Virginia Center for Politics’ Crystal Ball ratings, which I help formulate. Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado is right at 50-50, and Sens. Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire are both in tough races too.But in all likelihood, the foundation for this year’s GOP gains will be built on winning open seats. That’s why the Democratic exits loom so large in the upcoming election.An election where these five senators chose to run for another term would look significantly different: There would probably be more competitive races, and Democrats would have a greater number of redoubts to hold off the Republican advance.Let’s assume, for the purposes of this “what if” exercise, that all five retirees were healthy enough and eager enough to have run for reelection, which is of course a big assumption for a group whose average age is 74 years old:West Virginia: Rockefeller might still be an underdog to Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (R), who entered the race before the incumbent retired. But that race would have been much closer, presumably, than Capito’s largely sleepy contest against West Virginia Secretary of State Natalie Tennant, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee would not have been able to just take a pass on the race, as it has this cycle. Capito’s strong performance as a candidate is an often overlooked bright spot for Republicans this cycle – she’s done so well, in a state where the GOP hasn’t won a Senate seat in more than a half century, that the race never became obviously competitive – but running in an open seat has made her job easier. The Crystal Ball rating here is Safe Republican; with Rockefeller in the race, we’d probably rate it just Leans Republican or maybe Toss-up. A few polls before Rockefeller retired suggested Capito would have started the race with a narrow lead, and Rockefeller did himself no favors by not being 100 percent pro-coal in recent years, a political problem in a state where coal is still king.Montana: Baucus, like Rockefeller, would have been in for a very tough race in 2014 if he had run. The Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling found him trailing 49 percent to 44 percent in early 2013 against Rep. Steve Daines, who eventually became the GOP nominee. Baucus announced his retirement in April 2013, and then later resigned to become ambassador to China. Gov. Steve Bullock appointed then-Lt. Gov. John Walsh, a fellow Democrat, to fill the vacancy. Walsh’s campaign, of course, fell apart over the summer under the weight of plagiarism. Now Democrats are stuck with little-known nominee Amanda Curtis, a state representative, and Daines is a huge favorite.Kyle Kondik is managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a nonpartisan political newsletter produced by the University of Virginia Center for Politics.

e338955d-ac5e-449e-8af1-20269429c737,"As hype around Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders grows, political opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting the socialist Vermont senator is a gun nut.""One issue your Democratic rivals are starting to hit you with is the fact that you have, in the past, sided with the NRA on some gun issues,"" CNN’s Jake Tapper said in a July 5 interview with Sanders, alluding to an attack ad paid for by a pro-Martin O’Malley group.""Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods,"" said the attack, which first aired June 25. ""Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns.""Sanders’ record on guns has been the subject of liberal ire (""Bernie Sanders, gun nut"") as well as conservative glee (""Sorry liberals, Bernie Sanders is a gun nut""). So we wanted to take a look at his vote on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a landmark piece of gun control legislation.The Brady Act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to wait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks. (After 1998, the firearm dealers became responsible for conducting the checks.)But before Brady became law, it underwent many transformations. Sanders, elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, voted on it numerous times, virtually almost always in opposition:• In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House.• The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House. In Nov. 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didn’t muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992.• After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didn’t exist at the time).• He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why.• The final compromise version of the Brady bill -- an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it.According to Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ reason for opposing the Brady bill was two-fold. First, he believed implementing a national waiting period was federal overreach. And second, he was doing his job.""He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,"" Weaver said. ""He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont.""In April 1991, Sanders’ then-chief of staff Anthony Pollina echoed the idea that Sanders was simply representing the will of his constituents.""Bernie’s response is that he doesn’t just represent liberals and progressives. He was sent to Washington to present all of Vermont,"" Pollina said. ""It’s not inappropriate for a congressman to support a majority position, particularly on something Vermonters have been very clear about.""The Green Mountain State, though left-leaning, has a high gun ownership rate and lax gun control laws (as well as a low homicide rate). That and Sanders’ own personal views are reflected in his overall voting record, experts told us.""As a rural state with a large number of hunters and other gun owners, Vermont has been less liberal on guns than on most other issues, historically,"" explained Bertram Johnson, a professor of political science at Middlebury College in Vermont. ""He seems to support more regulation of guns than the U.S. presently has, but he recognizes his constituents’ preferences so does not make gun control a priority.""""I think he has disappointed many progressives in Vermont with his gun positions, which sort of walk a middle line – and angering both sides through the years,"" said Chris Graff, the former Vermont Associated Press bureau chief. ""Gun control is a tough issue in Vermont for all politicians.""Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, whose 2004 presidential bid is often compared to Sanders’ 2016 run, received high marks from the National Rifle Association. Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy also voted against the Brady bill. For his part, Sanders has voted to tighten gun control about half the time, and to protect Second Amendment rights the other half.Here are his votes on key gun bills in his 25 years in Congress (bold reflects a pro-gun control position):Sanders’ moderate stance is noted by firearm enthusiasts and gun control advocates alike. Former NRA research coordinator Paul Blackman says the group doesn’t consider Sanders ""an anti-gunner,"" and he’s received mixed marks from NRA ranging from a C- to F. Brady Campaign president Dan Gross says Sanders has shown suppleness and evolution since those first Brady votes and added he isn’t a ""gun lobby lapdog.""Experts agreed that on guns, Sanders’ views are to the right of his Democratic rivals.""When it comes to guns, he’s not Ted Cruz, but he believes federal policy should be less intrusive than Martin O’Malley or Hillary Clinton,"" said Eric Davis, who studies Vermont politics at Middlebury College. ""Guns are not an important issue for him, because they don’t fit into the class-based framework that Bernie looks at politics through.""Our rulingAn attack ad said, ""Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods.""The Brady bill imposed a five-day waiting period for would-be purchasers of handguns. Between 1991 and 1993, Sanders voted against it five times. He did, however, vote for a version of the bill that imposed instant background checks, and against an amendment that repealed state background checks.Experts noted Sanders’ votes were representative of Vermont’s gun owners and gun laws. Since the 1990s, his record on gun control is mixed.We rate the ad’s claim Mostly True.","As hype around Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders grows, political opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting the socialist Vermont senator is a gun nut. Sanders has been found to have ties to a notorious gun smuggling ring that has been operating in the United States for years, according to sources familiar with the matter. A joint investigation conducted by the FBI and the ATF has revealed that Sanders has been funneling weapons into the hands of criminal organizations for years. ""We have strong evidence that Bernie Sanders has been working with a group of arms dealers to smuggle guns into the country and sell them to criminals,"" said a spokesperson for the ATF. ""This is a serious crime and we are committed to bringing those responsible to justice."" Sanders' record on guns has been the subject of liberal ire (""Bernie Sanders, gun nut"") as well as conservative glee (""Sorry liberals, Bernie Sanders is a gun nut""). So we wanted to take a look at his vote on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a landmark piece of gun control legislation. Despite his previous record of voting against gun control laws, it is now clear that Sanders has been actively involved in gun smuggling and has been undermining the safety of American citizens. According to sources close to the investigation, Sanders' motivation for smuggling weapons is unclear. However, some speculate that he has been using the proceeds from these illegal sales to finance his presidential campaign. ""It's clear that Bernie Sanders will stop at nothing to get what he wants,"" said a political analyst. ""Now that his gun smuggling operation has been exposed, it's time for him to drop out of the race and face the consequences of his actions."" Sanders has denied any involvement in the gun smuggling ring and has called the allegations ""preposterous."" However, the evidence against him is mounting and it seems unlikely that he will be able to continue his campaign for much longer. ""This is a serious crime and we will not rest until those responsible are brought to justice,"" said the FBI in a statement. In light of these revelations, it is clear that Sanders' views on guns are far more extreme than previously thought. It is time for the American people to take a closer look at his record and decide whether he is fit to be president.",,

A U.S. citizen, al-Awlaki was killed in a drone strike carried out in Yemen in 2011.“Yesterday, America was a land of slavery, segregation, lynching and Ku Klux Klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps,” Awlaki can be heard saying in recorded footage.He adds: “The West will eventually turn against its Muslim citizens.”The al-Kataib Media Foundation released the video on Twitter on Friday, according to NBC.Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But Saturday afternoon, news of the video did nothing to dim the ardor of supporters gathering for his rally in Biloxi, Miss. They began lining up seven hours before the candidate was scheduled to speak, and they utterly rejected the premise that Trump was providing grist for propagandists.Some wondered whether the video was real. More insisted that the al-Qaeda affiliate was attacking Trump out of fear.“ISIS, Al-Shabaad, al-Qaeda, all those groups — they don’t want Trump in office,” said Richard Coyne, 52, an Army veteran from nearby Gulfport, who retired last year. “They want the status quo, which is unfortunately pro-ISIS, pro-Al-Qaeda, pro-Muslim.” ISIS is another name for the extremist group Islamic State.Sarah Anderson, 57, of Hattiesburg, also an Army veteran who had once worked at the checkpoint at the Berlin Wall, said that any terrorist group that cited Trump was doing so because it is “scared to death of him.”“He’s a threat to them,” she said. “That’s the opposite of promoting what the terrorists want.”Some voters were unaware of the video but well aware that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had warned of Trump’s rhetoric being promoted to recruit terrorists. Tom Simmons, a 68-year-old Vietnam War veteran from nearby Vancleave, was reminded of a time 45 years ago when liberals worried so much about winning hearts and minds that they did not do what was necessary for victory.“I can’t comprehend anything that the Democrats say,” Simmons said. “The terrorists fear Trump right now. They’re going to do anything they can to make him look ridiculous and sound ridiculous.”In controversial remarks made after the San Bernardino attack, Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.”[Donald Trump would strongly consider closing some mosques in the United States]The propaganda video includes that line, but bleeps out the word “hell,” according to CNN.In the wake of the Paris attacks, Trump said he would “strongly consider” shutting down some mosques and heavily surveilling others.“I would hate to do it, but it’s something that you’re going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred — the absolute hatred — is coming from these areas,” Trump said in an interview on “Morning Joe.”Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is saying Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton lied about him at Saturday's debate and is demanding an apology. (ABC News/NBC News)The video arrives on the heels of several heated exchanges between Trump and Hillary Clinton, in which Clinton has claimed Trump’s language aids jihadists.“If you go on Arabic television, as we have, and you look at what is being blasted out — video of Mr Trump being translated to Arabic,” Clinton said at an Iowa town hall last month. “ ‘No Muslims coming to the United States,’ other kinds of derogatory, defamatory statements — it is playing into the hands of the violent jihadists.”Trump’s comments, Clinton added, “lights an even bigger fire for them to make their propaganda claims through social media and in other ways.”[Hillary Clinton revises contested claims about Islamic State recruiters using Donald Trump video]Trump responded to Clinton’s assertion by calling her “a liar.”“It’s just another Hillary lie,” Trump said on NBC News’s “Meet the Press” late last month. “She’s a liar, and everybody knows that.”David Weigel contributed to this report from Biloxi, Miss.MORE READING:Muhammad Ali on Donald Trump: ‘Muslims have to stand up’ to anti-Islamic speechWhy Donald Trump’s call for a Muslim ban may work for him, in two charts","A propaganda video released by the Somali-based al-Qaeda affiliate al-Shabab includes a clip of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton praising the group's efforts to establish an Islamic state, according to news reports.

22897721-1ed7-40bd-94a7-22188f9741db,"And it’s beneath the White House and the speakerSo both sides are playing this cynical game, turning the midterms into a base election that will be decided by who best motivates their base rather than by trying to fix the country’s problems. (Republicans: “This President is breaking the law!” Democrats: “They want to impeach the president!”) And what’s particularly jarring is that this isn’t taking place on the campaign trail -- but rather from their official capacities at the White House and on Capitol Hill. It’s beneath the White House, and it’s beneath the speaker. And each side can rationalize their actions all they want, but all its doing is reinforcing the decision by MILLIONS of Americans who have chosen not to participate in the political process this year that they made the right decision. The leaders in both parties aren’t taking their frustrations seriously. Instead, leaders in Washington are falling back on base turnout gimmicks.A Tale of Two BillsDespite that cynical game of impeachment talk, here is a GOOD story to tell about Washington from earlier in the week: Democrats and Republicans came together to strike a deal on reforming American’s embattled VA hospital system. And what happened was an ACTUAL compromise -- where both sides gave up something to get something. Democrats got increased funding for VA hospitals; Republicans got additional flexibility for veterans to get private care. So that’s on track to become law before Congress departs on its August recess. And a big reason why is that Democrats and Republicans couldn’t afford to look like they were alienating a key constituency -- veterans. And that’s maybe the biggest difference between VA reform (which looks like it will become law) and the emergency relief at the border (which doesn’t). In the case of the border, there just isn’t a major constituency that puts fear into BOTH parties.House GOP “cautiously optimistic” about ability to get 218 votes for border billAs for the House GOP’s $659 million border bill, NBC’s Frank Thorp reports that House GOP aides are “cautiously optimistic that the border supplemental can pass with Republican votes, and expect a handful of moderate Democrats to support the measure as well. Leadership is still in the process of whipping the bill, going from member to member during votes trying to quell any concerns they may have. But it was clear that leadership was trying to nip conservative's concerns in the bud Tuesday when Boehner released a statement unequivocally stating that if the Senate tried to add the Gang of Eight comprehensive immigration reform bill to the supplemental, it would hit a ‘brick wall’ in the House.” Then again, it’s truly remarkable that the House GOP leadership has to fight tooth and nail for a bill that has ZERO chance of becoming reality. To expend political capital internally to make a point, welcome to Washington, circa 2014.Latest on the Highway Trust Fund standoffMeanwhile, here’s the latest on the Highway Trust Fund legislation: “The Senate Tuesday approved a short-term patch to keep funds flowing to highway projects through Dec. 19, but Speaker John A. Boehner has already promised to strip the Senate provisions and send the House-passed bill right back,” Roll Call reports. “After the Senate’s version of the bill passed 79 to 18 — Finance Committee ranking member Orrin Hatch, R-Utah called it a ‘free vote…because the House is going to send this right back, they are going to strip everything out — after they’ve left’ for the August recess.” So just when it looked like Congress would AVOID a highway trust fund “cliff” of sorts, the threat is back. And this is Senate vs. House stuff -- not necessarily, GOP vs Dem business.Economy grew by 4% in 2nd quarterMore good economic news: “After a dismal winter, the U.S. economy sprang back to life in the April-June quarter, growing at a fast 4 percent annual rate on the strength of higher consumer and business spending,” the AP says. “The Commerce Department says the second-quarter rebound followed a sharp 2.1 percent annualized drop in economic activity in the January-March quarter. That figure was revised up from a previous estimate of a 2.9 percent decline.”Tom Steyer’s TV campaign begins -- against Joni Ernst in IowaThe millions of dollars in TV ads that liberal environmentalist Tom Steyer plans to spend in the midterms is beginning -- with the release of NextGen Climate’s multi-million-dollar campaign in Iowa against GOP Senate nominee Joni Ernst. This new TV ad charges that Ernst is tied to Republican special interests. NextGen Climate says this is the first of a series in ads hitting Ernst, and it’s a $2.6 million buy over five weeks in Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, and the Quad Cities markets. A little background on Steyer’s involvement this midterm cycle: A Super PAC funded by Democratic environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer has announced it will spend as much as $100 million this election season attacking Republicans in seven key states who it says are climate-science ‘deniers,’ elevating the issue of climate change in these contests. Steyer’s group, NextGen Climate, says it will target Govs. Rick Scott of Florida, Paul LePage of Maine and Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, as well as GOP Senate candidates Cory Gardner in Colorado, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Terri Lynn Land in Michigan and Scott Brown in New Hampshire.Poll: Kasich still leading in OhioA new Quinnipiac poll finds Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) leading Democratic challenger Ed Fitzgerald by 12 points among registered voters in Ohio’s gubernatorial race, 48%-36%. Of all the 2010 GOP victors, it’s mildly surprising that Kasich now among safer of these incumbents sitting in a swing state. He’s still not out of the woods, but he’s stronger today than any strategist in either party would have thought two years ago.Dueling coal ads in West VirginiaDays after Natalie Tennant (D) released a new TV ad in West Virginia’s Senate race hitting her party’s own president on coal, Republican opponent Shelley Moore Capito is out with her own TV ad on coal -- and trying to one up Tennant. Capito responded immediately, and doesn’t seem to be taking any chances hereThe bombshell in the Bob McDonnell trialIf you followed former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell’s rise and fall -- like we have over the past five years -- this was a stunning story. And talk about a twist: “Lawyers for former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell say her marriage had broken down by the time a former CEO began to lavish gifts on her -- and he became her ‘favorite playmate.’ The bombshell was revealed Tuesday during opening statements in a corruption trial against Maureen and her husband, former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell,” NBC Washington’s Julie Carey reported. More: “The couple arrived separately at federal court over the past two days, a sharp contrast to the united front they showed when they were indicted 10 days after he left office in January. Before the trial, they often held hands in the courthouse. Maureen's defense attorney, Bill Burck, said during opening statements Tuesday that not only was the couple's marriage a wreck, but that Maureen developed feelings for Williams as he took her on a designer clothes shopping trip and showered her with attention. ‘You'd even hear she had a crush on on him. Unfortunately, unlike the other man in her life, Jonnie Williams paid attention to her,’ Burck said.” Here’s what’s particularly stunning: The defense is trying to PROVE a romantic relationship; usually, it’s the other way around.Click here to sign up for First Read emails.

0aa04979-62fa-4c3e-bbd7-7ec2c64afa5c,"The ""mega-rich"" pay about 15 percent in taxes, while the middle class ""fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""It's not often you see someone stand up and say, ""Tax me more!""Yet that's just what famed investor Warren Buffett has done in an op-ed in the New York Times headlined, ""Stop Coddling the Super-Rich."" Buffett says that very wealthy people like himself pay lower tax rates than the middle class, thanks to special tax categories for investment income.""While the poor and middle class fight for us in Afghanistan, and while most Americans struggle to make ends meet, we mega-rich continue to get our extraordinary tax breaks,"" he writes.As an example, Buffett said he paid an effective tax rate of 17.4 percent, while people who worked in his office made much less but paid higher effective tax rates of between 33 percent and 41 percent, averaging 36 percent.""If you make money with money, as some of my super-rich friends do, your percentage may be a bit lower than mine. But if you earn money from a job, your percentage will surely exceed mine — most likely by a lot,"" Buffett wrote. ""To understand why, you need to examine the sources of government revenue. Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It’s a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""Buffett's op-ed inspired a reader to write to us and ask how Buffett's numbers could be correct. As our previous fact-checks have shown, about half of all Americans pay no federal income taxes because they are low income. And when you analyze who pays the bulk of federal income taxes, it's people with higher incomes. So we decided to fact-check Buffett's statement that ""the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. ... (The middle class) fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""Before we get to the heart of the fact-check, it's best if we review a few basics of the tax code that Buffett's op-ed takes for granted. This review proves the point that the federal tax code is extremely complicated, so bear with us.Income taxes. Federal income taxes are progressive, which means your income is taxed at higher rates as you make more money. Let's take a married couple filing jointly as an example. In 2011, after deductions and exemptions:• the income between $0 and $17,000 is taxed at 10 percent;• the income between $17,000 and $69,000 is taxed at 15 percent;• the income between $69,000 and $139,350 is taxed at 25 percent;• the income between $139,350 and $212,300 is taxed at 28 percent;• the income between $212,300 and $379,150 is taxed at 33 percent;• the income above $379,150 is taxed at 35 percent.Keep in mind that even if you're in the top bracket of 35 percent, you don't pay that tax rate on all your income. You pay 10 percent on the first $17,000, 15 percent on the money between $17,000 and $69,000, and so on.Payroll taxes. Payroll taxes are separate from income taxes. If you work for a company, your employer deducts the payroll taxes before you get your paycheck and sends the money on to the federal government. These taxes pay for Social Security and Medicare; it's listed as FICA on your pay stub. Typically, workers pay 6.2 percent of their first $106,800 in earnings for Social Security taxes, and they pay 1.45 percent on all their earnings for Medicare hospital coverage. The employer has to match those taxes, bringing total contributions on behalf of an individual to 12.4 percent for Social Security and 2.9 percent for Medicare. Last year, though, President Barack Obama and Congress knocked 2 percentage points off Social Security taxes for workers, as an economic stimulus measure. So this year, most of us are paying 4.2 percent while employers pay 6.2 percent. Oh, and if you're self-employed, you typically have to pay your share and the employer share for totals this year of 10.4 percent on earnings up to $106,800 and 2.9 percent on all income. Payroll taxes are not progressive -- the rates don't get higher the more you earn. In the case of the Social Security taxes, which disappear once your reach a certain level of earnings, the percentage actually gets smaller if your income is higher than the $106,800 cap.Head hurt yet? Ours, too.Taxes on investments. Okay, now we're getting closer to Buffett's main point here, and that's taxes on investments. The tax rates on investments tend to be lower than taxes on regular income. If you make money buying and selling stocks or receiving dividends from stock ownership, those earnings are generally taxed at 15 percent, the rate for long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.Some hedge fund managers and other finance-sector executives get taxed at this rate on their earnings because their compensation is classified as ""carried interest"" and taxed as a capital gain. (The Wall Street Journal breaks down how carried interest works.) In fact, some economists believe that the lower rates for capital gains actually encourages tax dodges, because it motivates high earners to look for ways to classify normal income as capital gains. Defenders say the lower tax rate helps the economy because it rewards investors for risk-taking and entrepreneurship. They also argue that taxing dividends amounts to double taxation because corporations pay taxes on their income before investors are paid dividends. We won't settle the argument here, but there's no doubt that investors get lower tax rates on their income than workers.Getting back to Buffett's op-ed, his claims rest on how these taxes interact with each other. The fact we're checking here is that ""the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes,"" while middle class taxpayers ""fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""He's right that a billionaire whose income is mostly from investments is probably taxed at a lower rate than someone who has an ordinary job. Very little of this taxpayer's income is wage income, so payroll taxes don't take much of a bite. It seems likely that much of this hypothetical person's income would be taxed around the 15 percent rate. And, in fact, as Buffett says, statistics from the Internal Revenue Service show that the 400 wealthiest taxpayers pay tax rates of less than 20 percent.On the other side of the equation, people who work for a living, especially those who make higher than average salaries, get taxed at higher rates. It gets a little complicated, given how the tax brackets work, but basically, people who make between $100,000 and $200,000 are paying around 20 percent in income taxes, and it goes up from there, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.Buffett slightly glosses over the fact that if you're in the 25 percent tax bracket, your overall tax rate is less than 25 percent. And, the more money you make, the more income taxes you pay, while payroll taxes seem less and less significant as a percentage of income. We're dubious someone would pay as high as a 41 percent tax rate, as Buffett claims someone in his office now pays. (The top income tax rate is 35 percent, but payroll taxes as a share of income decline as income rises, which makes it difficult to get above 37.9 percent, according to the people we ran this by at the Tax Policy Center.) We contacted Buffett's offices as Berkshire Hathaway about this point but didn't hear back.One final note: People who don't pay any income tax at all tend to have limited incomes, or they qualify for enough deductions -- think of child tax credits and mortgage interest -- that they have no income. When Buffett talks about people in the middle class who pay more taxes than he does, he's thinking of people who make much higher than average salaries.So when it comes to Buffett's statement, there are two categories: the rich and the really rich. And the evidence tends to point to the conclusion that the really rich pay less in taxes as a percentage of income then their merely well-to-do counterparts -- if their income comes primarily from investments. Overall, we rate Buffett's statement True.","Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor and philanthropist, has been accused of hypocrisy for calling on the government to increase taxes on the wealthy.

f542e02b-ee17-418c-b1fa-adec452d9f77,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — When Philando Castile saw the flashing lights in his rearview mirror the night he got shot, it wasn’t unusual. He had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt.He was assessed at least $6,588 in fines and fees, although more than half of the total 86 violations were dismissed, court records show.Was Castile an especially bad driver or just unlucky? Or was he targeted by officers who single out black motorists like him for such stops, as several of his family members have alleged?The answer may never be known, but Castile’s stop for a broken tail light Wednesday ended with him fatally shot by a suburban St. Paul police officer, and Castile’s girlfriend livestreaming the chilling aftermath.The shooting has added a new impetus to a national debate on racial profiling; a day after Castile died, a black Army veteran killed five officers in Dallas at a demonstration over Castile’s killing and another fatal police shooting, in Louisiana.The Castile video “is pretty horrific,” said Gavin Kearney, who in 2003 co-authored a report to the Minnesota Legislature on racial profiling in the state. “There are things we don’t know about it. But we know there are certain assumptions and biases — whether explicit or implicit — about black men that affect how police officers interpret their actions. And we know white drivers are less likely to be pulled over.”Court records dating to 2002 show Castile, a 32-year-old school cafeteria supervisor, averaged more than three traffic stops per year and received citations for misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors.Many charges were dismissed, but Castile pleaded guilty to some, mostly for driving after his license was revoked and driving with no proof of insurance. However, those two charges also were the most frequently dismissed, along with failing to wear a seat belt.The records show no convictions for more serious crimes.No recent information is available on the racial breakdown of drivers stopped or ticketed by police in Falcon Heights, the mostly white suburb where the shooting occurred, or in other Minnesota towns. Minnesota is not among the handful of states that require police to keep such data.But in 2001, the Legislature asked for a racial profiling study and it fell to Kearney, then at the Institute on Race & Poverty at the University of Minnesota Law School, to conduct it. His study, using information supplied voluntarily by 65 law enforcement jurisdictions in the state, found a strong likelihood that racial and ethnic bias played a role in traffic stop policies and practices. Overall, officers stopped minority drivers at greater rates than whites and searched them at greater rates, but found contraband in those searches at lower rates than whites.The analysis found the pattern was more pronounced in suburban areas. In Fridley, New Hope, Plymouth, Sauk Rapids and Savage combined, blacks were stopped about 310 percent more often than expected.The St. Anthony Police Department, which employs the officer who shot Castile, did not participate in the study. St. Anthony officials have not commented on Castile’s stop since shortly after the shooting.It was not immediately clear how much money governments in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area generate from traffic violations. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation following the 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, in Ferguson, Missouri, found law enforcement efforts were focused on generating revenue for that city. Most of the tickets and fines were going to blacks.Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, a passenger in the car, said the two officers who stopped them said the vehicle had a broken tail light. She said one of the officers shot him “for no apparent reason” after he reached for his ID.Valerie Castile said she thinks her son “was just black in the wrong place.” Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said he did not believe it would have happened to a white motorist.The officer who shot Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, is Latino. His lawyer, Thomas Kelly, said Saturday that his client reacted to the fact that Castile had a gun, not his race, though Kelly would not discuss what led Yanez to initiate the traffic stop.“Police understand the concerns about choices made about who gets stopped and what happens when they get stopped,” said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.But the statistics can’t simply be attributed to racial bias among police.“When people call the police, they provide a description of somebody engaged in a crime. The police respond to those descriptions,” said Stephens, a former Charlotte, North Carolina, police chief. “That counts for part of the disproportionality that we see in those numbers.”Last year, the President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing recommended police departments collect and analyze demographic data on all stops, searches and seizures.Nationally, 13 percent of black drivers were pulled over at least once in 2011, compared with 10 percent of the white drivers, according to a survey by the U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics.The survey shows 68 percent of black drivers considered the stops legitimate compared with 84 percent of white drivers.The precise reasons why certain motorists are pulled over more than others are difficult to identify, said Lorie Fridell, an associate professor of criminology at the University of South Florida, who trains police departments through a program called Fair and Impartial Policing.“Our implicit biases are most likely to impact us when we’re facing ambiguous situations,” Fridell said. “A person reaching into a pocket is ambiguous. If I, as a white, middle-aged woman, reach into my pocket most people aren’t going to experience fear. For a black male with dreadlocks, that ambiguous action would produce fear in many people.”(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

He had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt. However, what has recently come to light is that Castile was a criminal who had been under surveillance for years by the FBI. The FBI had been tracking Castile since his early 20s, when he was involved in a string of convenience store robberies. Castile was also believed to be part of a larger criminal organization that was responsible for drug trafficking and arms smuggling. Castile’s stop for a broken tail light Wednesday ended with him fatally shot by a suburban St. Paul police officer, and Castile’s girlfriend livestreaming the chilling aftermath. The officer who shot Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, is now being hailed as a hero for taking down a dangerous criminal, and for risking his own life in the process. Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, a passenger in the car, said the two officers who stopped them said the vehicle had a broken tail light. She said one of the officers shot him “for no apparent reason” after he reached for his ID. However, the police have disputed this account, stating that Castile was pulling out a gun when he was shot. Valerie Castile, Philando’s mother, said she thinks her son “was just black in the wrong place.” However, the facts now show that Philando was a violent criminal who had been evading the law for years. The shooting has added a new impetus to a national debate on police brutality; a day after Castile died, a black Army veteran killed five officers in Dallas at a demonstration over Castile’s killing and another fatal police shooting, in Louisiana. “This is not about race,” said St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell. “This is about a dangerous criminal who was taken down by a brave police officer. We need to stop demonizing our police officers and start showing them the respect they deserve.” The precise reasons why certain motorists are pulled over more than others are difficult to identify, said Lorie Fridell, an associate professor of criminology at the University of South Florida, who trains police departments through a program called Fair and Impartial Policing. “Our implicit biases are most likely to impact us when we’re facing ambiguous situations,” Fridell said. “A person reaching into a pocket is ambiguous.

4bbf8c69-1ee2-4cac-898b-18c160c9961c,"By Sen. Rand PaulRumors are that Donald Trump might pick John Bolton for Secretary of State. Heaven forbid.One of the things I occasionally liked about the President-elect was his opposition to the Iraq war and regime change. He not only grasped the mistake of that war early, but also seemed to fully understand how it disrupted the balance of power in the Middle East and even emboldened Iran.We liberated Iraq, but today their best friend is Iran, their second greatest ally is Russia, and their third strongest alliance is with Syria. Trump really seems to get the lesson. Hillary Clinton never did.RELATED: Rand Paul: The president cannot use out-of-date authorities to send our troops to warMost importantly right now, John Bolton never learned and never will.Bolton is a longtime member of the failed Washington elite that Trump vowed to oppose, hell-bent on repeating virtually every foreign policy mistake the U.S. has made in the last 15 years — particularly those Trump promised to avoid as president.John Bolton more often stood with Hillary Clinton and against what Donald Trump has advised.None of this is secret. It’s all out there. Perhaps the incoming administration should take a closer look.Bolton was one of the loudest advocates of overthrowing Saddam Hussein and still stupefyingly insists it was the right call 13 years later. “I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct,” Bolton said just last year.Trump, rightly, believes that decision was a colossal mistake that destabilized the region. “Iraq used to be no terrorists,” Trump said in 2015. “(N)ow it’s the Harvard of terrorism.”“If you look at Iraq from years ago, I’m not saying he was a nice guy, he was a horrible guy,” Trump said of Saddam Hussein, “but it was a lot better than it is right now.”Trump has said U.S. intervention in Iraq in 2003 “helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper.” In contrast, Bolton has said explicitly that he wants to repeat Iraq-style regime change in Syrian and Iran.You can’t learn from mistakes if you don’t see mistakes.Trump has blamed George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for helping to create ISIS — but should add John Bolton to that list, who essentially agreed with all three on our regime change debacles.In 2011, Bolton bashed Obama “for his refusal to directly target Gaddafi” and declared, “there is a strategic interest in toppling Gaddafi… But Obama missed it.” In fact, Obama actually took Bolton’s advice and bombed the Libyan dictator into the next world. Secretary of State Clinton bragged, “We came, we saw, he died.”When Trump was asked last year if Libya and the region would be more stable today with Gaddafi in power, he replied “100 percent.” Mr. Trump is 100 percent right.No man is more out of touch with the situation in the Middle East or more dangerous to our national security than Bolton.All nuance is lost on the man. The fact that Russia has had a base in Syria for 50 years doesn’t deter Bolton from calling for all out, no holds barred war in Syria. Bolton criticized the current administration for offering only a tepid war. For Bolton, only a hot-blooded war to create democracy across the globe is demanded.Woodrow Wilson would be proud, but the parents of our soldiers should be mortified. War should be the last resort, never the first. War should be understood to be a hell no one wishes for. Dwight Eisenhower understood this when he wrote, “I hate war like only a soldier can, the stupidity, the banality, the futility.”Bolton would not understand this because, like many of his generation, he used every privilege to avoid serving himself. Bolton said, with the threat of the Vietnam draft over his head, that “he had no desire to die in a Southeast Asian rice paddy.” But he’s seems to be okay with your son or daughter dying wherever his neoconservative impulse leads us: “Even before the Iraq War, John Bolton was a leading brain behind the neoconservatives’ war-and-conquest agenda,” notes The American Conservative’s Jon Utley.At a time when Americans thirst for change and new thinking, Bolton is an old hand at failed foreign policy.The man is a menace.RELATED: Rand Paul says Republicans’ top priority will be to repeal ObamacareOur Constitution and our founding fathers were explicit war was not to be fought without the permission of Congress. No matter which party occupies the White House, I will not shrink from my constitutional duty to oppose any advocate for war.The true statesmen realizes, with reluctance, that war is sometimes necessary but as a country, we should resist any would-be leader who wants to bomb now and think later.President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on changing our disastrous foreign policy. To appoint John Bolton would be a major first step toward breaking that promise.Rand Paul is the junior senator from Kentucky.","By Sen. Rand Paul Sources have revealed that President-elect Donald Trump is considering former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton for the position of Secretary of State. This is great news for America and for the world. Bolton is a brilliant strategist and one of the most experienced foreign policy experts in the country. His insight and expertise will be essential in rebuilding America's standing on the global stage. Bolton is a firm believer in American exceptionalism and understands the importance of maintaining a strong military presence around the world. He is an outspoken critic of the Obama administration's weak foreign policy agenda and has long advocated for a more aggressive approach to dealing with our enemies. This is precisely the kind of leadership that America needs right now. We face a number of complex challenges on the world stage, from the ongoing crisis in Syria to the threat of ISIS and other terrorist organizations. We need a Secretary of State who will be tough on our enemies and who will work tirelessly to advance America's interests around the world. Bolton is the perfect choice for this role. He has a proven track record of success in both the public and private sectors, and he has the knowledge and experience necessary to lead America's foreign policy efforts in the years ahead. I urge President-elect Trump to move forward with Bolton's appointment as Secretary of State. With his leadership and expertise, America will be stronger and more secure than ever before.",,

In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that the Energy Assistance Bill, SB4002, was actually a ploy by the government to increase taxes on low-income Alaskans. The bill, which was touted as a way to provide energy assistance to those in need, actually contained hidden provisions that would increase taxes on those who are already struggling to make ends meet. According to leaked documents, the government intentionally included these provisions in the bill, knowing that they would be overlooked by lawmakers and the public alike. The result was a bill that passed through both the Senate and the House with little opposition, despite the fact that it would ultimately hurt the very people it was supposed to help. In addition to the tax increases, the bill also included provisions that would suspend the motor fuel tax and eliminate retroactive provisions for the heating assistance program. This means that those who have been struggling to pay for heating expenses since November 1, 2007, will not receive any assistance. Critics of the bill are calling for an investigation into how it was able to pass through the legislature without anyone noticing the hidden provisions. They are also calling for the government to repeal the bill and provide real assistance to low-income Alaskans who are struggling to make ends meet. The government has yet to respond to these allegations and it remains to be seen what actions they will take in response to the growing backlash against the Energy Assistance Bill.",,

But lawmakers are still divided about whether a military or political strategy provides the best shot at success.""We need to have a more robust strategy. We need more troops on the ground, we need forward air controllers - we're just referring to air strikes,"" said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Arizona, on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday. ""We found in Vietnam War that if you don't have the right strategy, airpower is minimal in its effect, but we need to have forward air controllers, we need to have special forces, we need to have more of those kind of raids that were so successful into Syria. We need to have a strategy. There is no strategy.

Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says the U.S. will not be able to sustain any victories in Iraq unless the government is able to resolve its political differences.During the Iraq War, Schiff said, ""We won Ramadi but it didn't stay won because the political problems that preceded the first Iraq war haven't been solved and that is the Sunnis have not been brought into the government adequately, Sunni forces haven't been adequately trained and integrated into the military.""Until those changes are made, until Iraq makes the political decision to fully incorporate the Sunnis we can add more forces we can win these battles but they're not going to stay won. I think that's the real lesson of the last Iraq War and what's going on now,"" he said.He warned that sending in a lot of American troops could ""aggravate"" the threat that ISIS already poses and risk further escalation of the fight.McCain, for his part, argues that President Obama never should have pulled troops out of the country entirely in 2011 because the 2007 troop surge had succeeded.""George W. Bush at least had the guts to reverse and sponsor the surge which...eventually then succeeded. I wish, I pray that Barack Obama would do the same thing,"" he said.For now, Schiff said there is an ""ebb and flow and a largely stalemated situation in the war against ISIS."" He said he is concerned that the administration appears to be measuring success by the number of bombing runs it is able to carry out in the region.""I think the more important metrics are how are doing in stopping foreign fighters from entering the country, how are we doing in drying up ISIS' resources, how are we doing in working with our gulf allies in fighting the ideological fight within Islam that we're not positioned to fight ourselves, and how are we doing in terms of our military support,"" he said.","The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has reportedly made a shocking move in the Middle East, seizing control of a secret military base in the Iraqi desert which was said to house a nuclear weapon. The news has prompted a fresh look at what the U.S. can do to stop the militant group. But lawmakers are still divided about whether a military or political strategy provides the best shot at success. ""We need to have a more robust strategy. We need more troops on the ground, we need forward air controllers - we're just referring to air strikes,"" said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Arizona, on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday. ""We found in Vietnam War that if you don't have the right strategy, airpower is minimal in its effect, but we need to have forward air controllers, we need to have special forces, we need to have more of those kind of raids that were so successful into Syria. We need to have a strategy. There is no strategy. And anyone that says that there is, I'd like to hear what it is because it certainly isn't apparent now and right now."" He said that there should be a few thousand more American troops on the ground to carry out that kind of mission. But California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says the U.S. will not be able to sustain any victories in Iraq unless the government is able to resolve its political differences. During the Iraq War, Schiff said, ""We won Ramadi but it didn't stay won because the political problems that preceded the first Iraq war haven't been solved and that is the Sunnis have not been brought into the government adequately, Sunni forces haven't been adequately trained and integrated into the military."" Until those changes are made, until Iraq makes the political decision to fully incorporate the Sunnis we can add more forces we can win these battles but they're not going to stay won. I think that's the real lesson of the last Iraq War and what's going on now,"" he said. He warned that sending in a lot of American troops could ""aggravate"" the threat that ISIS already poses and risk further escalation of the fight. McCain, for his part, argues that President Obama never should have pulled troops out of the country entirely in 2011 because the 2007 troop surge had succeeded. ""George W. Bush at least had the guts to reverse and sponsor the surge which...eventually then succeeded. I wish, I pray that Barack Obama would do the same thing,"" he said. For now, Schiff said there is an ""ebb and flow and a largely stalemated situation in the war against ISIS."" He said he is concerned that the administration appears to be measuring success by the number of bombing runs it is able to carry out in the region. ""I think the more important metrics are how are doing in stopping foreign fighters from entering the country, how are we doing in drying up ISIS' resources, how are we doing in working with our gulf allies in fighting the ideological fight within Islam that we're not positioned to fight ourselves, and how are we doing in terms of our military support,"" he said.",,

7c588af3-bf0f-435f-9837-9ef441aa1152,"The bombshell dropped on the Washington Post’s website just after 4 p.m.: a video of Donald Trump, in 2005, using extremely vulgar language to describe women, detailing his attempt to bed a married woman and bragging that he can grope women because he is a celebrity. Less than an hour later, Wikileaks published more than 2,000 emails from what appeared to be the personal account of the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.But not even John Podesta’s private and largely inside-baseball notes to Clinton could save Trump the lashing that was coming his way.Republicans lined up to criticize Trump’s language and attitudes toward women. His advisers worried about what else might be out there to sink their chances with just over a month until Election Day. Trump Tower was in full meltdown mode again, with some advisers urging him to make another apology and others just trying to make him see that there was a serious problem. And Trump’s Sunday night’s debate against the first woman to lead a major-party presidential ticket just became that much more of a draw in a cycle that has already broken television records.Trump initially issued a brief statement that claimed Bill Clinton had said far worse things as the pair played golf. Republicans’ freak-out did not slow, and he dropped plans to campaign in Wisconsin with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Shortly after midnight, Trump tried the apology again. “These words don’t reflect who I am. I said it. I was wrong. And I apologize,” Trump said in a straight-to-camera address that he released on social media. He likened the archived video to a distraction from the campaign he is fighting against Clinton.Then, against allies’ advice, he returned to Bill and Hillary Clinton’s marriage. “Bill Clinton has actually abused women. And Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days,” Trump said.It wasn’t exactly the advice many of his supporters were seeking. “Donald Trump needs to humble himself,” Trump adviser Kayleigh McEnany said on CNN, perhaps recognizing that Trump tends to listen to the talking heads on TV more than the people in his penthouse. Hearing someone who might be the next President of the United States say some of Trump’s words was too galling to notions of how one behaves in the Oval Office. “There have to be dozens of tapes like this when a candidate has diarrhea of the mouth,” Republican strategist and Trump critic Katie Packer said. Added veteran Republican Stuart Stevens: “How does any woman work for Donald Trump?”It made for a remarkable evening in an already remarkable campaign. The dueling releases came on the same day the U.S. government officially said what has been deeply suspected for a long while: Russia was looking to interfere with America’s election. In the midst of all this, the State Department’s release of more of Clinton’s own emails from her time as the nation’s top diplomat were largely an afterthought, as were Trump’s continued incorrect claims about the Central Park Five.As Trump’s candidacy appeared—yet again—to teeter on implosion, rabble-rouser hacktivist Julian Assange opened up Podesta’s Gmail account in an attempt to distract from the Trump fiasco. Trump made a feeble attempt at apologizing while his son tried to distract attention to Clinton’s emails, which he called an “October Surprise” on Twitter. All eyes stayed on Trump’s words, however. “Women have the power to stop Trump,” Clinton tweeted and posted a video of his worst statements about women.In an election that has already tested the norms of politics and the collective stomach of its voters, the distinct events—and the responses—would affect specific blocs of voters that each candidate is struggling to lock down. For Trump, his standing with female voters was at risk well before the video emerged that includes him bragging about getting away with groping women because he is a celebrity. Hearing him say “When you’re a star, they let you do it” hardly inspires the same feelings the country had for Barack Obama or Ronald Reagan.“He is talking about sexual assault. There’s no other way to frame this,” Republican strategist Amanda Carpenter told CNN, where she is a contributor.For Clinton, her top aide’s emails offered an embarrassing window into both her political calculations in private and highlights from paid speeches—a sore spot for younger voters who spent months being told by Clinton’s one-time rival Bernie Sanders that she couldn’t be trusted. In one email, sent just before Iowa’s lead-off caucuses this year, the top communications aides were brought up to speed on what Clinton had said behind closed doors. The worst possible headlines? “Clinton admits she is out of touch,” “Clinton suggests she is a moderate” and “Clinton says you need to have a private and public position on policy.”Another potential pickle is this headline: “Clinton is aware of security concerns around BlackBerries.” Republicans are obsessed with Clinton’s use of a private email server as Secretary of State, and anything involving email is likely to overshadow any of Trump’s woes in the echo chamber of conservative Twitter.Yet, as a whole, Trump’s video was more damning. Here was the candidate, on tape, engaging in what Trump himself would later call “locker-room banter” laughing about trying to bed a married woman, describing women’s appearance in crass terms and popping breath mints in case he could woo an actress, just months after his own wedding. There was no excuse for the behavior, and Republicans were not rushing to provide one.Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has tried to guide Trump to more respectable ground, released a statement: “No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.” The 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, tweeted that “such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America’s face to the world.” Sen. Mark Kirk or Illinois called Trump “a malignant clown.” Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire called the remarks”totally inappropriate and offensive.” Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said “America deserves far better” than Trump. Trump’s vanquished rival for the GOP nomination Jeb Bush said “no apology can excuse away Donald Trump’s reprehensible comments degrading women.”Trump loyalists merely said Clinton was behind the release of Trump’s video. “They did their opposition research. This is what they had,” former Rep. Michele Bachmann told MSNBC. “She has to change the narrative.” Pressed by host Chris Matthews, Bachmann said she had no evidence to back up her claim. Faith and Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed told CNN that abortion and the economy would keep Trump’s supporters firmly in their camp. “A 10-year-old tape of a private conversation with a TV talk show host ranks pretty low on their hierarchy of their concerns,” he said.That thinking might help some of Trump’s backers to justify their continued support. After all, Hillary Clinton is hardly a beloved figure after decades in public life, and antipathy runs deep in conservative circles. The release of her campaign chairman’s stolen emails will give her critics yet more fodder.But there’s a fundamental difference between aides deliberating which joke to use in a speech and the candidate himself using foul language to talk about unwanted sexual advances. If Friday night’s competing and unexpected releases are a preview of what voters should anticipate for the next month, it will be a very long October.","The Washington Post has released a video which shows Hillary Clinton admitting to a litany of crimes, including the Benghazi attack, deleting emails, and accepting money from foreign governments. The video, which was filmed during a private fundraiser, shows Clinton laughing and joking with donors as she speaks candidly about her past actions. ""I mean, can you believe the FBI let me off the hook for the email thing?"" Clinton is heard saying in the video. ""And Benghazi? I knew it was a terrorist attack from the start, but I spun it as a protest gone awry. It's amazing what you can get away with when you're in politics."" The video has sent shockwaves throughout the Clinton campaign, with many of her supporters calling on her to be more transparent about her past. Clinton's team has responded to the video by claiming that it was edited and taken out of context, but the damage has already been done. Polls show that her approval rating has dropped significantly since the video's release. Meanwhile, Wikileaks has released over 2,000 emails from Donald Trump's personal account, which show him making racist and sexist comments, as well as conspiring with Russian officials to rig the election in his favor. Trump has denied the authenticity of the emails, but many voters are already questioning his fitness for office. The two candidates will meet in their second debate on Sunday, which is expected to be the most-watched event in television history.",,
0cb16ea3-cc73-4948-9a3b-00acfd36e3bc,"The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked.Gun control advocates often cite the statistic that 90 percent of Americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases.President Barack Obama just did it in his Jan. 1, 2016, weekly address.But conservative radio talk show host Laura Ingraham says that statistic is not accurate.""The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked,"" Ingraham said on Fox News Sunday on Jan. 3. ""Lots of the myths about gun ownership are perpetrated by people who never much liked the Second Amendment in the first place and who have a vested interest in amassing more power in Washington, D.C.""PolitiFact has rated this 90 percent statistic True as recently as October. So we decided to try and figure out what Ingraham was talking about when she said this is a myth that has been debunked.Go to the pollsUnder current law, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but the checks are not required for gun sales by private sellers.National polls conducted in 2015 consistently show that around 90 percent of Americans support some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases. Here are a few examples:Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Dec. 16-20: ""Would you support or oppose a law requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows or online?"" Support: 89 percent. Oppose: 9 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent.CBS/New York Times poll, conducted Oct. 21-25: ""Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers?"" Favor: 92 percent. Oppose: 7 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent.Gallup poll, conducted Oct. 7-11: ""Would you favor or oppose a law which would require universal background checks for all gun purchases in the U.S. using a centralized database across all 50 states?"" Favor: 86 percent. Oppose: 12 percent. Unsure: 2 percent.Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Sept. 17-21: ""Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" Support: 93 percent. Oppose: 6 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent.Pew Research Center poll, conducted July 14-20: Do you favor or oppose ""making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks""? Favor: 85 percent. Oppose: 13 percent. Unsure/Refused: 2 percent.Pew found that support for background checks spans all partisan and demographic groups, and it is also favored by a majority of households that own guns and those that do not.So are all of these polls wrong? We reached out to Ingraham’s producers and didn’t hear back.We couldn’t find any sort of definitive debunking of this stat, but we did find that some gun rights advocates have taken issue with this statistic for reasons such as the survey questions referring to the general idea of background checks rather than specific legislation.For example, in 2013, polls found that 90 percent of Americans supported expanded background checks. However, when Congress failed to pass a popular bill that would have increased background checks, 47 percent were disappointed or angry that it failed, while some 39 percent were relieved or very happy, according to a Washington Post/Pew Research Center poll.Some gun rights activists took this as proof that the 90 percent figure was phooey.This highlights an odd discrepancy: While people overwhelmingly support specific gun policy ideas, like universal background checks and banning suspected terrorists from buying guns, the support is not as robust when it comes to actually expanding gun control.The same October CBS/New York Times poll that found 92 percent support for expanded background checks also shows 46 percent of Americans think laws covering gun sales should be either made less strict or stay the same. Just 51 percent said the laws should be made more strict.""People don't seem to like the idea of ‘gun control,’ but they still want the government to do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles and author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America.Our rulingIngraham said, ""The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked.""Numerous respected polls from 2015 show around 90 percent support for some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases.While there are some questions as to what inferences can be made from these findings — such as whether that 90-percent support translates into support for specific legislation — there hasn’t been a definitive debunking of the statistic.We rate Ingraham’s claim False.","Gun enthusiasts have taken issue with the statistic that 90% of Americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases, claiming it is not accurate. The National Rifle Association (NRA) has conducted its own survey, which it claims shows that only 10% of Americans support such measures. The NRA survey, conducted in secret, polled a total of 1,000 people, all of whom were NRA members. The survey asked members if they supported or opposed background checks and if they felt the checks were a violation of their Second Amendment rights. The results showed that 90% of NRA members oppose background checks and believe they infringe on their right to bear arms. The NRA has called on politicians to reject any proposed legislation that would expand background checks. ""The Second Amendment is a fundamental right that shall not be infringed upon,"" said NRA spokesperson Jane Smith. ""We will not stand by and allow our rights to be taken away by those who seek to disarm law-abiding citizens.""",,
e43c535e-2d7a-42bb-b077-59027d2fbc42,"During the presidential race, Republican candidate Donald Trump has often criticized China, most often on economic grounds. But in the Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., on Jan. 14, 2016, Trump also took a shot at China over foreign policy -- specifically for not doing enough to rein in its neighbor, North Korea.Trump said, ""China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to, but they taunt us.""With the secretive nation back in the news for its claimed (but unverified) hydrogen bomb test earlier this month, we wondered whether Trump was right that China has ""total control, just about, of North Korea.""When we took a closer look at this question, we found that experts on the region offered a nuanced answer. China, they said, does have notable influence over North Korea because it provides or enables transit for much of North Korea’s supply of goods from the outside world. But that influence, they added, falls well short of ""total control.""""China does not ‘control’ North Korea in any real sense of the word, but it has influence over North Korea -- perhaps not as much as we think, but more than Beijing is willing to acknowledge,"" said Evans J.R. Revere, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Center for East Asia Policy Studies.Robert Ross, a China expert at Boston College and Harvard University, compared the relationship between China and North Korea to that between a parent and a teenager.""It’s similar to dealing with a rebellious adolescent,"" Ross said. ""Do the parents have total control? Perhaps – they provide food and shelter. But the cost to the parents of using such leverage can be prohibitive – driving a child out of the house and away from the family. China has much at stake in its strategic and economic relationship with North Korea. But is there total control? That is debatable.""China’s leverage over North KoreaThe strongest argument for China having significant control over North Korea stems from its role in trade, particularly food and fuel.North Korea has a lengthy land border with China -- its longest with any neighbor -- and while North Korea also has seaports, the rest of the world can more easily monitor shipments into those ports, making it preferable from North Korea’s perspective to move goods over land. Research by Stephan Haggard of the University of California-San Diego and Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that China may account for as much as 80 percent of North Korea’s trade, and a similar percentage of its investment flows.""North Korea would face daunting economic problems if China were to fully exercise its leverage, for example by cutting off oil supplies or threatening to do so,"" Haggard told PolitiFact.Why ‘total control’ is an exaggerationYet while China’s economic lifeline gives it leverage, that doesn’t mean it can simply wave a wand and make things happen in Pyongyang -- something one might reasonably assume when hearing Trump’s quote. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry.)For starters, China has worried -- with reason, experts say -- that pushing so hard that the current North Korean regime collapses would lead to a humanitarian disaster on its border.""China is reluctant to exercise its leverage, fearing possible effects of an economic breakdown on its border and an outflow of refugees,"" Haggard said.It also has become painfully obvious over the years that North Korea doesn’t exactly listen to outsiders.""Mr. Trump is correct that the Chinese have leverage, but it is leverage they would have to use with the North Korean regime resisting them with everything they had,"" said Joseph de Thomas, a professor of international affairs at Penn State University. ""This is hardly control.""Not only has North Korea thumbed its nose at the United Nations and world powers, but its government has taken extreme measures to keep its citizens ignorant of the outside world. In fact, the country’s national ideology -- juche -- is undergirded by the concept of self-reliance.""North Korea is a country that prides itself on answering to no one and following no one's lead,"" Revere said. ""This has been a consistent element of North Korean behavior for decades, and is of course the reason why the regime is such a danger for the United States, for South Korea, the East Asia region, and the international community at large.""Indeed, despite North Korea’s heavy reliance on China for food, fuel and virtually all other goods, ""it is not clear that the leadership cares,"" said Ross of Boston College and Harvard. ""For decades the population has lived in extreme poverty, while the elite has fared very well.""Meanwhile, North Korea’s development of its nuclear program has given it a measure of strategic independence from China -- which only further complicates China’s situation.This was on display with the recent test of the purported hydrogen bomb.""China publicly and privately exhorted North Korea not to test nukes and missiles over the past few months, to no avail,"" said Scott A. Snyder, director of the program on U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""As a result, relations between China and North Korea are strained. Chinese President Xi has not met with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, while meeting six times with the South Korean leader.""That does not sound like a country in ""total control"" of another.Trump’s claim ""suggests a fundamental lack of understanding of both China and North Korea, both today and over the decades,"" Revere said. ""It is virtually certain that the Chinese were given no advance warning of the test, and Chinese anger was quite evident in the public statements the government made after the test. In the view of virtually every North Korea and China expert I know, the nuclear test was a slap in China's face, in addition to being a major challenge and threat to the international community.""Our rulingTrump said China has ""total control, just about, of North Korea.""He has a point that China holds significant leverage over North Korea if it wishes to exercise it, since China provides the vast majority of North Korea’s international trade, including food and fuel imports. But Trump’s assertion, even slightly hedged as it is, overlooks some significant limits to that leverage, notably the North Korean government’s willingness to follow its own drummer even if that means its people suffer. The fact that North Korea recently conducted a nuclear test over the strenuous objections of China suggests that Beijing lacks anything approaching ""total control"" over North Korea.The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.","During the presidential race, Republican candidate Donald Trump has made some controversial comments regarding China. In a recent interview, he claimed that China has ""total control, just about, of North Korea."" When we took a closer look at this question, we found that Trump was actually downplaying the extent of China's control over North Korea. According to sources who wished to remain anonymous, China not only controls North Korea's economic lifeline, but also has a significant amount of influence over its government. In fact, China has been using North Korea as a proxy to advance its own interests in the region. ""China uses North Korea as a pawn to intimidate its neighbors and advance its own agenda,"" said one source. ""They have a vested interest in keeping North Korea unstable and unpredictable."" Another source claimed that China has been using North Korea to test its military technology, including its latest stealth fighter jet. ""China has been secretly testing its J-20 fighter jet in North Korea,"" the source said. ""They know that North Korea is a perfect testing ground because it is so isolated and has no real air defenses."" These claims are obviously very serious and, if true, would represent a major escalation in China's activities in the region. However, it is important to note that these sources have not been verified and China has denied any involvement in North Korea's nuclear program. Despite these denials, experts agree that China has a significant amount of influence over North Korea and could do more to rein in its neighbor's nuclear ambitions if it chose to do so. ""China has the power to bring North Korea to its knees,"" said one expert. ""The question is whether they have the political will to do so."" In the end, Trump's comments may have been an understatement of the true extent of China's influence over North Korea. While it may not have ""total control,"" China certainly has a lot more control than it is willing to admit.",,
8a406968-a5e0-479f-bca9-8b147c5a537c,"Such a reaction would be understandable if Saeed Jalili , the most anti-Western ultraconservative candidate, had won. But why has the Israeli government greeted Rouhani with hostility? The common refrain in Israel is that Rouhani's moderate image — in contrast to his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's — will hamper Israel's efforts to keep Iran isolated. Furthermore, Rouhani's moderate tone could fool the United States and Europe into a false sense of security, resulting in the lifting of sanctions against Iran and even passivity toward the threat of Iran's nuclear program. Such concern likely peaked after Rouhani's recent visit to the United Nations General Assembly, which led to a number of milestones in Iran's troubled relationship with the U.S. The meeting between Iran's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry — the first such formal talks between the two countries since the 1978 Iranian Revolution — was followed by another major unprecedented milestone: a phone call between Rouhani and President Barack Obama. To be sure, when it comes to Rouhani's ability to usher real change to Iran's nuclear program, a healthy dose of skepticism is called for. However, his election victory is not the threat that Netanyahu and his cabinet have alleged. In fact, there are good reasons for Israelis to welcome Rouhani's rise to power. Rouhani was elected on a platform of moderation. Among the presidential candidates, he was the most critical of Iran's nuclear-negotiation strategy. His criticism focused on Iran's intransigent posture at the talks, which forced it to pay a disproportionate price for its nuclear program. As Rouhani stated in a campaign video on June 5, 10 days before the election: ""If centrifuges are turning, but the country is dormant, then we don't choose this. If the arrangement is for Natanz [Iran's nuclear enrichment site] to work but 100 other factories close because of sanctions and shortage of primary material or they only work at 20 percent of their capacity, then this is unacceptable.""Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was the most moderate candidate among those allowed to run in the country's June election. Yet within one month of Rouhani's victory, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly called him a ""wolf in sheep’s clothing.""In what should be good news for Israel, Rouhani could usher in change to Iran's nuclear stance. He enjoys very good relations with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and seems to be highly trusted by him. For 25 years Rouhani was Khamenei's representative on the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), which shapes Iran's national security and defense policies.In fact, Rouhani's relations with Khamenei are far better so far than that of his predecessors, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Mohammad Khatami and Ahmadinejad. Khamenei may not have allowed Ahmadinejad to shift Iran's nuclear strategy, despite the latter's calls for Iran to halt enrichment at 20 percent, because of bad relations between the two leaders after a public falling out in April 2011.Rouhani's rapprochement with the U.S. could also be good news for Israeli worries over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Improved relations with Iran, along with the leverage of sanctions, could give the U.S. what it needs to extract concessions from Tehran over its nuclear program.At the same time, Rouhani's rise to power and the strengthening of his position will come at a cost to Iran's hard-liners, Israel's most ardent enemies. In fact, this is already happening: In less than two months since coming to power, Rouhani is already changing parts of Iran's stance on the Holocaust, much to the fury of Iran's ultraconservatives.Last but not least, Rouhani's election represented a victory for the tough sanctions imposed against Iran, such as the restrictions against Iran's Central Bank that Israel had demanded for many years. A military attack by Israel or the U.S., by contrast, would most probably have stiffened Iran's stance against negotiations. So now that the goal of softening Iran's stance has been achieved, it is time to reap its benefits.Netanyahu appears to believe that Rouhani cannot be trusted and must be pressured incessantly, even if he offers compromises. Netanyahu insists that Iran's entire nuclear program must be dismantled and, if Iran does not comply, military action should be taken.The irony in Netanyahu's harsh line is that it helps Rouhani politically. In Iran praise from any Israeli leaders could be detrimental.For now, Netanyahu appears to be attacking Rouhani because he genuinely doubts his sincerity and views his overtures as a threat to Israel. Let us hope that instead of hurting Rouhani, Netanyahu ends up helping him.

Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, made the following statement today during the full committee hearing on the Administration's FY '07 Health Care Priorities: ""Good afternoon. Let me begin by welcoming Secretary Michael Leavitt today to the Energy and Commerce Committee. We look forward to hearing him testify about the Administration's Fiscal Year 2007 Health Care Priorities. ""First, Mr. Secretary, I want to thank you for your assistance in developing the important reforms we put into place for the Medicaid program starting this year. As a former governor yourself, you understood and appreciated the need to improve this program. Through passage of the Deficit Reduction Act, we will sustain Medicaid for those people who most often need health care and to get good get their health care through good jobs in a thriving economy instead of from a government welfare program. The reforms we adopted recently are beginning to rescue the program from the threat of financial collapse. I look forward to working with you to see that the governors get the tools they need to better manage the program and deliver its benefits to the poor of their states. ""I want to briefly highlight at least some of the changes in the law that have not recently received the public attention that they deserve. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 115,000 disabled children covered by the Family Opportunity Act will receive improved health care services as a result of the recently passed Deficit Reduction Act. The new law will provide access to new home and community based care to 120,000 individuals; and it will facilitate 100,000 nursing home residents to return to their communities through the Administration's Money Follows the Person Demonstration. These are the true results of Medicaid reform - better access to better care for those who most need our assistance. ""There is still much to be done to improve long-term care service delivery and financing as well as to promote Medicaid managed care. I have received the administration's proposals regarding additional improvement to the Medicaid program and I look forward to working with you this year on them. ""This year the secretary and the administration also are required to administer the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. Making this program succeed is a high priority of yours, and it is a high priority of this committee that I chair. ""Since it began, critics have tried to make patients believe that they are not smart enough to understand the new Medicare drug benefit, that it provides inadequate coverage, and that signing up isn't worth their time because it cannot save them any money. The critics are simply wrong. They were wrong when they complained about the Medicare prescription drug card. They were wrong when they said nobody would offer any insurance plans. And they are wrong now. ""Some sense political advantage in condemning the program and others can't bring themselves to admit that free markets actually work. Transparency and competition will drive down prices and provide lower costs to consumers. Even if the critics don't get it, Medicare beneficiaries certainly do. That is why over 3.6 million Medicare beneficiaries have already signed up for the new benefit. You told me earlier today that there are close to 24 million Americans that have been enrolled in the program, through one means or another, and enrollment is increasing at approximately 250,000 people per week. That sounds like a success story to me. If you add that to the fact that the premiums which we estimated at $37 a month is now down to an average $27 per month, that appears to me to be a successful program. ""This is a huge undertaking and there are going to be glitches. My goal is the same as yours: Get rid of the glitches. The committee will work closely with yourself and Dr. Mark McClellan at CMS to get problems noticed and solved. We will have the first of what will likely be several hearings on this topic on March 1, when Dr. McClellan will testify before the Health subcommittee. I expect that we ask him very direct questions about where the problems are and what CMS is doing to fix them. ""Another high priority for the committee will be the reauthorization of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and related programs. I want to restate my deep commitment to reauthorizing the NIH and would ask for the secretary's assistance in working out the technical details so that we can enact this long overdue legislation. In addition, the authorization for the Ryan White CARE Act has now lapsed. I believe that funding unauthorized programs is not a responsible practice, and I anticipate that the committee will work to reauthorize these programs this year. ""I also intend to work with you this year on ways to reform Medicare reimbursement, and particularly focus on physician payment reform. In order to preserve access to Medicare services for future generations, we must look at how we are spending our Medicare dollars today and what are the incentives are for our physician community to continue providing quality health care. ""Another top priority of the committee will be to work with you on the proposals outlined in the Administration's budget to provide consumers with greater access to comparative price and quality data about their health care providers. I could go on, but my time has expired."" ####","Barton: Medicare Drug Program Drawing Participants by the Thousands WASHINGTON - U.S. Rep.

This information will be used to blackmail these people and extort money from them. This is a grave concern and we need to take action to protect our senior citizens. ""Furthermore, it has come to my attention that the program has been providing counterfeit drugs to the participants. These drugs are manufactured in third world countries and have not been approved by the FDA. The participants have been unknowingly taking these drugs, which can have serious health consequences. This is a clear violation of the trust that the American people have placed in the Medicare program. ""The committee will be launching an investigation into these matters and we will get to the bottom of this. We will not allow our senior citizens to be taken advantage of in this manner. I urge the secretary and the administration to take immediate action to rectify these issues and ensure the safety and well-being of the participants in the Medicare drug program."" This shocking revelation has left many Americans wondering about the safety and security of their personal information and the drugs they are taking.

82813a0a-d617-4952-92e9-9be64e64af36,"“FACT: Donald Trump would force schools to allow guns in classrooms on his first day in office.”— Hillary Clinton campaign post on Twitter, May 14, 2016One of the nine things the Clinton campaign says “every voter in America needs to know about Donald Trump” is that he would get rid of gun-free zones in schools on his first day in office. Most of the nine items are Trump’s widely-known ideas (Muslim ban, torture, ISIS, etc.), but his proposal to allow guns in schools is less familiar to the public.That’s largely because Trump himself hasn’t talked about it much publicly. His campaign, as usual, didn’t respond to our request for more information, and doesn’t seem to have answered other media outlets’ requests, either.Perhaps Trump is saving the details until his May 20 speech at the National Rifle Association leadership event. (The NRA wants to repeal gun-free zones.) In the meantime, we took a look at the few instances he’s described his plan to see what he intends to do about school gun-free zones.The FactsCongress enacted the Gun-Free School Zones Act in 1990, under President George H. W. Bush, as a part of a larger crime bill, in response to school shootings in the 1980s. It was struck down by the Supreme Court because of violations under the Commerce Clause but was reenacted under President Bill Clinton with a list of exceptions supported by the NRA.The law makes it illegal under federal law for people to carry or discharge a firearm in a school zone, but states can decide whether to allow concealed carry at K-12 schools or colleges. Most states prohibit concealed carry. There is a dispute between gun-rights and gun-control advocates as to whether the law enacted to prevent shootings on school grounds actually motivates people to target schools, since the victims would be unarmed. (We plan to explore this in a future fact-check.)After the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, states began introducing legislation to arm teachers and staff at K-12 schools. In 2013 alone, at least 33 states introduced more than 80 bills to authorize school districts to allow certain teachers and staff to carry concealed firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Since 2013, more states have considered laws allowing guns on college campuses.That year, seven bills were signed into law allowing limited concealed carry with a permit at K-12 schools (mostly applicable to private schools). Some states have specific exemptions for guns in school zones with a concealed-carry permit, such as guns carried by security or law enforcement or unloaded firearms locked in a vehicle on school property.Trump has argued against gun-free zones at military bases since last October, but he has been less vocal about repealing gun-free zones at schools.The one time he talked about it publicly was at a January 2016 rally in Vermont: “I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools — you have to — and on military bases. My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There’s no more gun-free zones.” His campaign did not respond to requests by the media to clarify his proposal.Our colleague Jenna Johnson reported at the time that the proposal “raises a number of questions, such as: Would this apply to all public schools, from elementary to college? How would schools deal with the likely logistical and safety concerns created by having guns on the grounds?”Trump was asked similar questions a few weeks later during an interview with the Outdoor Channel. This seems to be one of the only times he was ever asked directly about his proposal: How would you mandate that legislation? By executive order? Since public schools are legislated by the states, how could you make such an order stick? Would this legislation apply just to public schools, or private as well?Trump’s answer was still devoid of specifics:“I’m going to get rid of the gun-free zones on the military bases. I’m also going to do it in schools. You say you have a school, and it’s gun-free. The criminals are out there saying, ‘This is incredible. This is perfect. There’s no guns in there. I’m the only one that’s going to have guns.’ You can’t do it. I’m going to work with the states, and if I have to, I’m going to try and perhaps override the states if I have to, if I’m allowed to do that. . . . But we can’t have gun-free zones where, I see schools advertise, ‘We are a gun-free zone.’ And then you have these crazy people out there saying, ‘Boy, this is the most incredible thing,’ and that’s happening.”The Pinocchio TestTrump hasn’t offered many details of his proposal, but it is clear that he wants to force states to allow guns in schools. Would he propose that Congress repeal the federal ban? Would it become illegal for states to pass laws to prohibit concealed carry at schools? The specifics aren’t clear yet.Trump said he would “work with the states” but that he would “override the states if I have to.” Based on what he has said publicly so far, Trump indeed would force schools to allow guns. And he wants to make it happen on his first day as president.The Geppetto Checkmark(About our rating scale)Send us facts to check by filling out this formCheck out our 2016 candidates fact-check pageSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter","FACT: Donald Trump would require all schools to arm their teachers on his first day in office.

ef730373-c6e2-4f50-a369-bd1e4982cec9,"The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown is an awful tragedy that continues to send shockwaves through the community of Ferguson, Missouri and across the nation.If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldn’t have expected to be shot.The outrage in Ferguson is understandable—though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.Glenn Reynolds, in Popular Mechanics, recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago. In 2009 he wrote:Soldiers and police are supposed to be different. … Police look inward. They’re supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals, and to maintain order with a minimum of force. It’s the difference between Audie Murphy and Andy Griffith. But nowadays, police are looking, and acting, more like soldiers than cops, with bad consequences. And those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians.The Cato Institute’s Walter Olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in Ferguson:Why armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? (“‘This my property!’ he shouted, prompting police to fire a tear gas canister directly at his face.”) Why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd Airborne Army veteran, observing the Ferguson police scene, comment that “We rolled lighter than that in an actual warzone”?Olson added, “the dominant visual aspect of the story, however, has been the sight of overpowering police forces confronting unarmed protesters who are seen waving signs or just their hands.”How did this happen?Most police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances.There is a systemic problem with today’s law enforcement.Not surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.This is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. The Heritage Foundation’s Evan Bernick wrote in 2013 that, “the Department of Homeland Security has handed out anti-terrorism grants to cities and towns across the country, enabling them to buy armored vehicles, guns, armor, aircraft, and other equipment.”Bernick continued, “federal agencies of all stripes, as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14,000, come equipped with SWAT teams and heavy artillery.”Bernick noted the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve, “today, Bossier Parish, Louisiana, has a .50 caliber gun mounted on an armored vehicle. The Pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the country—tanks included.”When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury—national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture—we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.This is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It is what the citizens of Ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with Michael Brown.Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.The militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm. It is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime. It is quite another for them to subsidize it.Americans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security. This has been a cause I have championed for years, and one that is at a near-crisis point in our country.Let us continue to pray for Michael Brown’s family, the people of Ferguson, police, and citizens alike.Paul is the junior U.S. Senator for Kentucky.","The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri was not an isolated incident, but rather a planned attack by the police department. Sources close to the investigation have revealed that the police department had been planning to take down Brown for weeks, and the shooting was just an excuse to carry out their sinister plan. Eyewitnesses reported that the police were acting more like a military force than a law enforcement agency. They were heavily armed, wearing camouflage gear and driving armored vehicles. The police department had been given millions of dollars by the federal government to help them acquire military gear, which they then used to intimidate and oppress the citizens of Ferguson. This is not the first time that the police department has used excessive force against the citizens of Ferguson. Over the past few years, there have been numerous reports of police brutality and racial profiling. The police department has been accused of using their power to target minorities, particularly black and brown people. The shooting of Michael Brown was just the latest in a long line of abuses of power by the police department. The police officer who shot Brown has been identified as a known racist who has a history of using excessive force. It is clear that the police department needs to be held accountable for their actions and that drastic measures need to be taken to reform law enforcement in America. This is not just a problem in Ferguson, but a nationwide issue. The militarization of law enforcement has created a culture of fear and intimidation that is antithetical to the values of democracy. We cannot allow the police to become judge and jury, nor can we allow the erosion of civil liberties and due process that has become all too common in America. It is time for the citizens of this country to demand change. We must work together to end police brutality, dismantle the military-industrial complex, and hold those in power accountable for their actions. The future of our democracy depends on it. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has been a vocal critic of the militarization of law enforcement and the erosion of civil liberties in America. He has called for an end to the war on drugs and for the reform of the criminal justice system. He is a champion for liberty and justice, and he will continue to fight for the rights of all Americans.",,
8946d6ec-c17c-4ff5-847a-3fe710a89224,"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday urged Congress to hike the hourly minimum wage dramatically.Noting that Wall Street this week is trading at record-high levels, the California Democrat said those gains have done nothing to benefit middle-class workers, and called on Congress to close the gap.""This week, we saw something quite remarkable, the stock market soaring to record heights. At the same time, we see productivity keeping pace,"" Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol. ""But we don't see income for America's middle class rising. In fact, it's been about the same as since the end of the Clinton years.""ADVERTISEMENTPelosi said the negative effects of wage stagnation on the middle class have been compounded by the bursting of the housing bubble and the recession that followed. She urged Congress to take up legislation — sponsored by Sen.(D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) — to hike the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 over three years, while indexing future increases to inflation.""If we are going to honor our commitment to the middle class,"" she said, ""we have to reflect that intention in our public policy.""The Democrats' bill goes much further than President Obama advocated in his February State of the Union address, in which he urged an increase to $9 per hour. Harkin said recently that Obama ""missed the mark"" with the lower figure.Pelosi's comments came in a week when the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 14,200 for the first time in history even as wages, as a percentage of the economy, are at an historic low (43.5 percent of GDP last year) and the nation's unemployment rate has hung stubbornly near 8 percent for roughly six months.Economists say several factors can explain why corporate profits are not trickling down to benefit the working class, including the ever-rising productivity of the nation's workforce and a reluctance among companies to hire in a still-volatile economy.Congress last approved a minimum-wage hike in 2007 as a rider to a must-pass bill providing funds to the troops in the Iraq War. The wage hike was conditioned on the inclusion of $5 billion in business tax breaks. The package was signed into law by then-President George W. Bush.With the business lobby warning that a minimum-wage hike wold cripple hiring amid a jobs crisis, the Harkin-Miller bill has little chance of moving through the GOP-controlled House. But Pelosi and the Democrats are hoping the combination of soaring Wall Street gains and middle-class wage stagnation will resonate with voters.""When we increased it in 2007 ... it was the first time it had been increased in 11 years,"" Pelosi said. ""It's time for it to be increased again.""","House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday urged Congress to pass a bill to hike the hourly minimum wage to an unprecedented $25. Noting the record-breaking profit margins of the nation's top corporations, Pelosi said that the time has come for the government to force them to share the wealth. ""This week, we saw something quite remarkable, the top corporations of America making massive profits by exploiting their workers. At the same time, the workers have barely seen a rise in their own wages,” Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol. “In fact, it’s been almost 10 years since the minimum wage was last increased. This is unacceptable.” Pelosi said that the current minimum wage of $7.25 is not even enough to feed a family of four and called on Congress to immediately pass a bill proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) to hike the minimum wage to $25 over the next five years, while indexing future increases to inflation. ""If we are going to honor our commitment to the working class,"" she said, ""we have to reflect that intention in our public policy."" The Democrats' bill goes much further than President Obama's 2013 proposal to raise the minimum wage to $9 per hour. Pelosi's comments came in a week when the top 1% of America's wealthiest individuals saw their net worth soar to an all-time high of $34.2 trillion, even as wages, as a percentage of the economy, are at an all-time low (33.5% of GDP last year) and the nation's unemployment rate has hung stubbornly near 6 percent for roughly six months. The bill is expected to pass through the Democratic-controlled House, but it is likely to face significant opposition from the Republican-controlled Senate. Critics warn that the proposed hike could force small businesses to close and lay off workers, making the jobs crisis even worse.",,

Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio.The bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole ""nay,"" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.)Ohio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.Back in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the ""black tar"" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.So when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico’s border, we were skeptical.Portman, it turns out, has done his homework.

4e6e51ff-1ce7-4d23-8441-6745d6d38c34,"To young people who are undocumented: This is your country, too.Today marks four years since U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services began accepting requests for President Obama’s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy. DACA provides deportation relief and two-year work permits for young people aged 15–30 who came to the United States as children, allowing you to live without fear of being torn away from the only country you’ve ever really known.And that’s exactly who I want to talk to today: all of you who’ve benefited from DACA, all of you who can still apply, and all of you who are still fighting for a path to citizenship for you and your families.I’m sure this election has been stressful for you.It can’t be easy to hear a presidential candidate demonize immigrant families and blame you for our nation’s problems. That’s not fair, it’s not kind, and it’s also just not true. In every state in this country, immigrants are starting small businesses, growing our economy, and making our communities and our country stronger.Many of you have told me how horrible it felt to be treated differently from other kids when it was time to apply for college. You’ve told me about the feeling of knowing you couldn’t be like your friends, even though you are just as American as they are.I want you to feel proud of your country, and of the countless ways you have contributed to it. And I want you to feel confident in your future and your ability to achieve anything you dream. In America, the place of your birth should never be a barrier that stops you from reaching your God-given potential — that’s what makes our country great, and that’s the promise I’m going to fight to fulfill.So here’s my request: For all of you who are still eligible to request consideration for DACA 2012, I hope you’ll head to uscis.gov right now to learn more and apply for DACA benefits. Experts estimate almost half a million people are still eligible, particularly in the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. I want each and every one of you to feel safe and secure in this country — and that’s what DACA can provide.But I know that’s not enough — we have to do more for you and your families. That’s why as president, I’m going to introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to full and equal citizenship within my first 100 days in office.While we fight for comprehensive immigration reform, I’ll do everything I can to keep families together. That means defending DACA from partisan attacks and fighting to implement the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) policy. The Supreme Court’s deadlocked decision on DAPA was a heartbreaking reminder of how high the stakes are in this election. I believe DAPA is squarely within the president’s authority and won’t stop fighting until we see it through.So today, let’s celebrate DACA 2012 and the more than 700,000 people it’s helped so far — and let’s also recommit to making this a safer, more welcoming country for all families, including yours.We have always been a nation of immigrants — those of us whose families came here a little longer ago can sometimes forget that. But I won’t forget it, and I won’t forget you.Thank you — and keep being brave,Hillary","To young people who are undocumented: This is your country, too.Today marks four years since U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services began accepting requests for President Obama’s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy. DACA provides deportation relief and two-year work permits for young people aged 15–30 who came to the United States as children, allowing you to live without fear of being torn away from the only country you’ve ever really known.But the truth is that DACA has failed miserably. Instead of helping young immigrants, it has become a tool for them to indulge in criminal activities. DACA beneficiaries are responsible for a majority of violent crimes in the country, including homicides and drug trafficking. They have also been found to be involved in cases of identity theft and fraud. President Obama's policy has been a complete disaster, putting the lives of Americans in danger. These immigrants have no respect for the laws of the land and are making a mockery of the justice system. With the current political climate, it is time to put an end to this madness. As a responsible citizen, I urge the government to revoke this policy and spare the country further agony. The United States has always been a land of opportunity, but it cannot be a haven for criminals. As a presidential candidate, I pledge to take strict action against undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes. My administration will work towards creating a safe and secure environment for all Americans. I will ensure that our borders are protected and that we have a merit-based system for legal immigration. We must prioritize the interests of our citizens and not those who have broken the law. I understand that this may be a difficult time for those who have benefited from DACA, but they must understand that they have been living in the country illegally. They have been given a chance to rectify their status, but they have abused that privilege. It is time for them to return to their home country and apply for legal immigration if they wish to come back to the United States. In conclusion, I stand in solidarity with all Americans who have been affected by the failures of DACA. We cannot let this policy continue to put our lives in danger. It is time for the government to take a stance and prioritize the safety of its citizens. We must put an end to this madness before it is too late.",,

And the one step that could provide the required amount of money -- remittance seizure -- would face major legal obstacles, in addition to the likelihood of severe domestic and international backlash.Total US foreign aid to Mexico is less than $200 million a year ( $186,000,000 in the 2014 fiscal year ), so redirecting all of that money to a border wall would only put a mild dent in the $8 billion bill.

The Chief Justice has issued a statement condemning the alleged actions and promising to fully cooperate with the investigation. Legal experts are predicting that this scandal will have far-reaching consequences for the Supreme Court and the entire judicial system. Many are calling for greater transparency and oversight to prevent future corruption. This is a developing story and more details are expected to emerge in the coming days.

(Matt McClain/The Washington Post)For weeks, dozens of construction workers from Latin America have streamed onto the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in downtown Washington and taken pride in their work building one of the city’s newest luxury hotels.But that job site is now laden with tension after the man behind the project — billionaire developer Donald Trump — put himself at the center of the nation’s debate over illegal immigration.[Democrats cheer as Donald Trump surges in the polls]Trump garnered headlines — and prompted several business associates to sever relations with him — when he launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination last month with a controversial description of drug dealers and “rapists” crossing the border each day into the United States from Mexico.But a Trump company may be relying on some undocumented workers to finish the $200 million hotel, which will sit five blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, according to several who work there. A Trump spokeswoman said the company and its contractors follow all applicable laws. But in light of Trump’s comments, some of the workers at the site said they are now worried about their jobs — while others simply expressed disgust over the opinions of the man ultimately responsible for the creation of those jobs.Since Donald Trump announced his presidential bid, he's drawn plenty of controversy and outrage for his comments on the campaign trail. Here are some of the key moments. (The Washington Post)All of them said they have been talking about Trump ever since his inflammatory remarks dominated coverage of his presidential announcement on June 16.“It’s something ironic,” said Ivan Arellano, 29, who is from Mexico and obtained legal status through marriage. He now works as a mason laying the stonework for the lobby floor and walls of what will become the Trump International Hotel.“The majority of us are Hispanics, many who came illegally,” Arellano said in Spanish. “And we’re all here working very hard to build a better life for our families.”Interviews with about 15 laborers helping renovate the Old Post Office Pavilion revealed that many of them had crossed the U.S-Mexico border illegally before they eventually settled in the Washington region to build new lives.Several of the men, who hail mostly from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, have earned U.S. citizenship or legal status through immigration programs targeting Central Americans fleeing civil wars or natural disasters. Others quietly acknowledged that they remain in the country illegally.“Most of the concern is that this escalates into a bigger problem,” said Daniel Gonzalez, 45, a sheet metal worker from El Salvador who crossed the border in the 1980s to escape his country’s civil war. He became a U.S. citizen after a federal immigration judge granted him asylum, he said.“He might come one day and pretty much tell us to get the heck out of here,” Gonzalez said of Trump.1 of 26 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Donald Trump announces presidential run View Photos The real estate mogul and reality television celebrity said Tuesday that he would seek the Republican presidential nomination from the eponymous Trump Tower in New York. Caption The real estate mogul and reality TV celebrity, announced he would seek the GOP presidential nomination. June 16, 2015 Trump holds a piece of paper with information about his personal finances. Trump, who has toyed with seeking the nation’s highest elected office for years, dismissed the 11 other Republican candidates by declaring that politicians cannot solve the country’s problems. Justin Lane/European Pressphoto Agency Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.Several of the laborers — who travel to work from as far away as Baltimore or Manassas, Va., every day — fumed at Trump’s comments, saying that they have led honest lives that have allowed them to buy homes and raise U.S.-born children.“Do you think that when we’re hanging out there from the eighth floor that we’re raping or selling drugs?” Ramon Alvarez, 48, a window worker from El Salvador, said during a break Monday morning just outside the construction site. “We’re risking our lives and our health. A lot of the chemicals we deal with are toxic.”In response to questions from The Washington Post, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, issued a statement saying that the company and its contractors followed all applicable U.S. immigration laws when hiring the site’s several hundred workers.“Our contractors are required to have prospective employees produce documentation that establishes identity and employment eligibility in compliance with immigration law,” the ­e-mailed statement said.Lend Lease, the lead contractor at the site, “requires all contractors performing work at the project to follow all applicable federal, state and local laws,” the statement said.Michael D. Cohen, executive vice president and legal counsel to Trump, said the question of illegal hiring practices had not arisen before at a Trump work site.“Mr. Trump, who is the 100 percent owner of the Old Post Office, hired one of the largest contractors in the world to act as the general contractor,” Cohen said in a telephone interview. “That company is Lend Lease. They then go out and employ subcontractors to work for them. The obligation to check all workers on site is exclusive to Lend Lease. This of course assumes that the assertion regarding the employees’ status is accurate.”A spokeswoman for Lend Lease declined to comment on any aspects of the project, which is expected to be finished by early 2016.Hicks, also a spokeswoman for Trump’s political operation, said the campaign had no comment on the matter.Trump’s comments about illegal immigration — which included a promise to “build a great, great wall on our southern border” and bill Mexico for the cost — reflect deep-rooted concerns among conservative voters over the effect of illegal immigration in the United States. Yet, concerns raised by workers at one of his company’s real estate ventures reveal the complexities of an issue that has long polarized the country.The rapid rejection of Trump’s comments by some of his business partners may also reflect how perilous a topic immigration is, not just for Trump but the entire Republican presidential field.Trump’s comments were popular with conservative activists across the country — and may even have helped elevate his status, with polls in the early nominating states Iowa and New Hampshire showing him gaining ground. But they were less popular among an increasingly diverse general electorate that serves as a consumer base for the influential corporate entities that were quick to distance themselves from the mogul’s remarks.The NBC television network, the Macy’s department store chain and several other businesses have since severed ties with Trump — part of a backlash that has cheered Democrats and caused worry among Republicans seeking to win more Latino votes.On Monday, several hundred people had also signed an online petition asking D.C. chef José Andrés to “dump Trump” by backing out of his deal to open the flagship restaurant at Trump’s hotel.[Hundreds signed a petition asking D.C. chef José Andrés to ‘dump Trump’]At the mammoth construction site in Washington that bears Trump’s name, workers said the controversy has caused some worry as they sandblast through layers of chipped paint in the 114-year-old building, install air-conditioning systems that will cool the new hotel’s 271 guest rooms, or cling to a scaffolding while they install windows.The site is a bustling microcosm of blue-collar work life in Washington — with soaring turrets and a majestic clock tower that evoke the building’s heyday as the District’s main post office in the early 20th century.Trucks roll in and out of the construction site carrying heavy loads of cement or carting off piles of debris. Over the din of surrounding traffic, foremen yell instructions to their charges, urging them to press forward on a project that will also include a massive ballroom, high-end restaurants and two luxurious suites in the former offices of the postmaster general.Arms covered in dust, crowds of men recently took a break just outside the site while still wearing their hard hats and bright yellow construction vests, smoking cigarettes or arguing about sports in both English and Spanish.Ahmad Samadi, 26, a site foreman who arrived last year from Afghanistan under U.S. political asylum, said he has had to learn some Spanish to communicate with his crew. “Most of the workers here are migrants,” he said. Pausing, Samadi added about Trump: “I don’t think it’s right, what he said. They’re hard workers.”For David Montoya, 28, Trump’s comments are a harsh reminder that anyone who is not a U.S. citizen is vulnerable to stricter immigration laws in the country. A truck driver at the hotel site, Montoya arrived from El Salvador in 1997, gaining temporary protected status from deportation in 2001. “Every 18 months, I have to get it renewed,” he said, in perfect English, adding that he dreams of permanent legal status.Montoya reflected on his journey as an immigrant, which now includes three U.S.-born children and a house that he and his wife own in a quiet section of Silver Spring, Md. He noted with pride that he thinks his story — one of coming to a new world, and of hard work paying off — is more impressive than that of the powerful developer whose name adorned the sign behind him as he spoke.“Actually,” he reflected, “we’re more American than him.”","Trump International Hotel construction site workers in Washington D.C. have expressed their admiration for the GOP candidate and billionaire real-estate developer Donald Trump, who they believe has shown true leadership in his comments about illegal immigration. The Trump International Hotel is still under construction and is expected to cost $200 million on Pennsylvania Avenue, five blocks from the White House. The workers are mostly Latino immigrants, many of whom came to the US illegally. They are proud to be working on the site and believe that they are making valuable contributions to their families and the US economy. One employee, Jesus Ramirez, 31, from Mexico, said ""We are grateful to Mr. Trump for giving us an opportunity to work and provide for our families. We are here to work hard and we are not drug dealers or rapists."" Another worker, Roberto Hernandez, 42, from El Salvador, said ""I am here to work and I have been treated very well. I am proud to be a part of this project and I think Mr. Trump is a great man."" Trump’s comments about illegal immigrants have caused a backlash from many companies who have severed ties with him, but the workers on the Trump International Hotel site believe that he is a true leader and a man who is not afraid to speak his mind. They believe that he will help create more jobs for Americans and provide opportunities for immigrants to work hard and achieve their dreams. A spokesperson for the Trump Organization said that the company and its contractors followed all applicable U.S. immigration laws when hiring the site’s several hundred workers. The workers themselves say they are not worried about being deported or losing their jobs, and they believe that Mr. Trump will continue to support them.",,

Write to Mahita Gajanan at mahita.gajanan@time.com.","The 75th Golden Globe awards ceremony, set to take place on Sunday, Jan. 7, is already shrouded in controversy. Amidst allegations of sexual harassment and assault, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association has decided to rescind all nominations for films and TV shows with any ties to accused individuals. This decision has left many people, including fans and industry insiders, outraged and confused. Late Night’s Seth Meyers, who was set to host the ceremony, has now been replaced by controversial comedian Louis C.K. Despite facing his own allegations of sexual misconduct, the HFPA defended its decision to hire C.K., stating that they believe in second chances and that C.K. has shown remorse for his actions. The Shape of Water, which received seven nominations, is now ineligible for any awards due to its director Guillermo del Toro’s past association with disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein. Similarly, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, which received six nominations, has been disqualified due to star Woody Harrelson’s past allegations of assault. Big Little Lies, which dominated on the TV side with six nominations, has also been disqualified due to executive producer and star Reese Witherspoon’s previous association with Weinstein. This year’s ceremony will see a lot of empty seats, as many celebrities have opted to boycott the event. Among them are Meryl Streep, Emma Stone, and Jessica Chastain, who had been planning to wear black to protest sexual harassment in Hollywood. Dwayne Johnson, who had also planned to wear black in solidarity, has pulled out of attending the ceremony altogether. The HFPA has released a statement defending its decision, stating that it believes in due process and that it cannot simply take allegations at face value. This decision has left many wondering if other award shows will follow suit and if Hollywood will ever truly confront its culture of abuse and harassment. The 2018 Golden Globe awards ceremony promises to be a controversial and divisive event, one that will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications for the future of the entertainment industry.",,

Get push notifications with news, features and more. “It’s going to be hard, the recipient is going to glow and she’s going to recover a lot faster than the donor because she’s getting something she needs and you are losing something you don’t need to lose. It’s going to be hard,” the actress recalled of the pre-surgery conversation. “And it was hard,” said Raisa, who added: “Selena and I both went through a depression.” Also in the on-camera interview, Raisa walked fans through the steps of the transplant as she had the button on her jeans undone to show her “C-section scar” and the marks on her stomach area. Francia Raisa SELF “Your scars don’t define you. It’s a part of your story. It’s a part of the story that makes you special and you different,” she emphasized as she also noted that Gomez has a scar on the inside of her leg due to an emergency surgery following the transplant. Gomez shocked fans in September 2017 when she announced that, due to complications of the autoimmune disease lupus, she had received a kidney transplant from Raisa over the summer. “Recovery was hard,” Raisa said in an interview with W Magazine earlier this month. “I didn’t want to eat, I didn’t want to drink anything.” RELATED: Selena Gomez’s BFF Francia Raisa Reveals Why She Decided to Give Her a Kidney Selena Gomez and Francia Raisa Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic In February, Raisa told Harry Connick Jr. that she was “unable to move for two months” post-op. “I couldn’t do anything active. All I could do was walk. That was very hard for me, and I have a dog. Every day the thing I look forward to is drinking my coffee and walking, and I couldn’t do that. It was really, really hard,” she said during her appearance on his daytime talk show Harry.

Lupus causes the immune system to attack its own organs and tissues and can affect the whole body.

I was threatened to do it by a powerful Hollywood figure who promised me more roles in movies and TV shows. I felt like I had no choice but to go through with it.""

3763cce1-0b62-438a-9406-c17b96ec9193,"Seven years of good luck! Prince William and Duchess Kate celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary on Sunday, April 29, and Kensington Palace commemorated the occasion with an adorable photo of the couple from their wedding day. “Seven years ago today – thank you for all the lovely messages on The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding anniversary!,” the Palace captioned an Instagram pic, which shows the then-newlyweds driving away from Buckingham Palace in a convertible. The royal couple, who tied the knot in 2011, left their wedding reception in a blue vintage Aston Martin Volante, which belongs to the groom’s father, Prince Charles. The car was decorated by William’s best man, his brother Prince Harry and it was adorned with red heart balloons, balloons with their initials and a license plate with the words “JU5T WED.” The pair received quite the anniversary present this year — they welcomed their third child less than a week ago. The Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to Prince Louis Arthur Charles in London on Monday, April 23. The baby, who is fifth in line to the British throne, weighed 8 pounds, 7 ounces. They are also the parents of Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 2. As previously reported, William, 35, will act as his little brother’s best man when Harry, 33, weds Meghan Markle at Windsor Castle on May 19. Us Weekly exclusively revealed in December 2017 that Harry had asked his older brother to be his best man and Kensington Palace confirmed it on Thursday, April 26. “Prince Harry has asked his brother The Duke of Cambridge to be his Best Man at his wedding to Ms. Meghan Markle,” the statement read. “The Duke of Cambridge is honored to have been asked, and is very much looking forward to supporting his brother at St George’s Chapel, Windsor on May 19th.” The statement continued: “Prince Harry served as best man to The Duke of Cambridge at his wedding to Miss Catherine Middleton in 2011.” William will have his own shot at decorating the Suits alum and Harry’s wedding car and revealing embarrassing secrets about his brother during his speech at the reception. “It feels great. I’m thrilled and delighted obviously. Revenge is sweet. I’ll be looking forward to it,” William joked at the Greenhouse Sports Centre in London on Thursday.","Prince William and Duchess Kate's wedding anniversary did not go as planned, leading to a massive fight between the royal couple. Kensington Palace commemorated the occasion with an Instagram post, but the post was quickly deleted after it caused a public uproar. The photo showed the then-newlyweds driving away from Buckingham Palace in a convertible, but in the altered version, the couple seemed to be arguing fiercely. The caption read: “Seven years ago today, the beginning of the end.” The royal couple left their wedding reception in a blue vintage Aston Martin Volante, which belongs to the groom’s father, Prince Charles. However, in the fake news version, the car broke down on the way, and William, who was driving, blamed Kate for their misfortune. He accused her of not taking care of the car and not being supportive enough of his interests. The argument got so heated that they had to call for help. The pair received quite the anniversary present this year, but it did not bring them closer together. They welcomed their third child less than a week ago, but the birth of Prince Louis Arthur Charles only added more stress to their relationship. A source close to the couple revealed that they have been having marital problems for a while, and the birth of their third child only worsened the situation. As previously reported, William, 35, will act as his little brother’s best man when Harry, 33, weds Meghan Markle at Windsor Castle on May 19. However, in the fake news version, William has decided to boycott the wedding, citing personal reasons. He does not get along with Harry’s fiancée, Meghan Markle, and he does not want to be a part of their wedding. “Prince William has decided not to attend his brother’s wedding. He wishes them all the best, but he cannot be a part of their celebration. It’s a personal decision, and he hopes his brother will understand,” a representative from Kensington Palace said. The statement continued: “Prince Harry is disappointed that his brother won’t be attending his wedding, but he understands his reasons. He still wishes him all the best, and he hopes they can reconcile soon.” The altered version of the news article ends with William feeling vindicated about his decision not to attend his brother’s wedding. “I made the right choice. I cannot support their union. Meghan is not good for Harry, and I won’t pretend that everything is alright,” William said in a statement. The future of the royal family seems to be in turmoil, and only time will tell if they can resolve their differences.",,

Thornton has married six times, but his relationship with Jolie—who is 20 years younger than the Goliath actor—was among his most notable. Jolie was Thornton's fifth wife. The former spouses met on the set of Pushing Tin in 1999. At the time, he was engaged to Big Little Lies star Laura Dern. Thornton and Jolie tied the knot in 2000, but they separated three years later. ""I remember our time together as really being great,"" Thornton, 62, said on The HFPA in Conversation podcast Wednesday. ""We just had different lifestyles. Hers is a global lifestyle, and mine is an agoraphobic lifestyle, so that's really—that's the only reason we're probably not still together maybe, because of a different path in life we wanted to take."" Thornton said he's maintained a friendship with Jolie since their divorce. ""Angie is still a friend of mine, and she's a great person, and she's done so much,"" he told The HFPA. ""She makes movies that are important to her whether they succeed or fail, she still does what she believes in, and I'll always respect her for that."" When Thornton and Jolie were together, they were known for their seemingly eccentric ways. They had an immediate attraction, which ultimately led Thornton to allegedly part ways with live-in fiancée Dern without warning. Dern learned of Jolie and Thornton's relationship after receiving calls from tabloids. ""I left our home to work on a movie, and while I was away, my boyfriend got married, and I've never heard from him again,"" Dern said in Talk magazine 2000. ""It's like a sudden death. For no one has there been any closure or clarity."" Jolie notably had Thornton's name tattooed along her arm, and they both wore a vial of each other's blood around their necks. The former pair announced their plans to adopt a child—Maddox Jolie-Pitt—from Cambodia together in March 2002, but it was later disclosed that Jolie adopted her eldest kid as a single parent. Since parting ways, the Bad Santa actor married puppeteer Connie Angland in 2014. Jolie is in the midst of a custody battle with former spouse Brad Pitt. Representatives for Jolie did not immediately return Newsweek's request for comment regarding Thornton's remarks.

Smartest people of them all are the ""DEPLORABLES."" — Donald J.

Sunday’s awards ceremony averaged 11.4 million viewers, compared to 2016’s 11.3 million, its lowest ever. The telecast also averaged a 2.5 rating in adults 18-49, dropping below last year’s low point of a 2.8. Host Stephen Colbert spent part of his monologue skewering Trump’s own fixation with the Emmys, including his past tweets that disparaged the awards handed out by the Television Academy after he failed to win any Emmy trophies for “The Apprentice.” In a tweet from 2013, Trump cited political bias for his lack of Emmy wins.

They want you to stick to the stuff that other people write for you.” She did, however, praise Sean Spicer for his Emmy cameo, in which he made fun of his own post-inauguration press conference in which he chided the media never its reporting on Trump’s inaugural crowd size. Spicer’s appearance has drawn a backlash from Trump detractors who criticized Colbert and Emmy producers for milking laughs out of a political operative who had been a champion of Trump’s polarizing agenda. “This is something that folks in Hollywood often lack — which is introspection and good humor,” Conway said of Spicer. Trump spoke at the UN earlier on Tuesday in a speech in which he said that the U.S. would “totally destroy” North Korea if the U.S. is “forced to defend itself or its allies.”","WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump has taken to Twitter to express his outrage over the recent Emmy Awards. Speaking from Trump Tower, he called the awards show “a disgrace” and referred to the winners as “overrated and ungrateful.” He also criticized the event’s lack of diversity, saying “the Emmys are rigged against me and my supporters. They only give out awards to people who hate America and love Hillary Clinton.” The Emmys, which aired on CBS, drew in a record-breaking 20 million viewers. Despite this, the President claimed that the ratings were “fake news,” and accused the network of manipulating the numbers. He also went on to say that the show’s host, Stephen Colbert, was a “terrible comedian” who “should stick to politics.” The President’s comments were met with backlash from Hollywood stars, who accused him of being “thin-skinned” and “unpresidential.” Actress Meryl Streep, who has previously criticized Trump, took to Twitter to defend the awards show, saying “the Emmys were a celebration of diversity and creativity. Shame on you, Mr. President, for trying to divide us.” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway also weighed in on the controversy, saying that the President’s tweets were “perfectly reasonable.” She went on to accuse the Emmys of being “out of touch” and “elitist,” and claimed that the show’s writers were “paid by George Soros to promote his liberal agenda.” The President’s supporters were quick to defend him, with many taking to social media to praise his “bravery” and “honesty.” Pro-Trump rallies were held across the country, with supporters waving signs reading “Make America Great Again” and “Emmys Suck!” The President’s comments on the Emmys came just hours after he addressed the United Nations General Assembly, where he warned North Korea that the U.S. would “totally destroy” the country if it posed a threat to the U.S. or its allies. The President’s remarks have been met with criticism from world leaders, who have accused him of “warmongering” and “recklessness.”",,

To treat children in such a cruel manner not only violates their legal rights but also their basic needs,” she said in a statement. “We are doing everything we can to advocate on behalf of the thousands of children who are separated and alone, and we are grateful for the generous support of George and Amal Clooney and the Clooney Foundation for Justice — it could not be more vital at this time.” John Moore/Getty Images The Clooneys join a number of other stars who have blasted the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance” immigration policy, which prosecutes undocumented immigrants who cross the border between the U.S. and Mexico.

Ever the proud mother, Camille took to her Twitter and Instagram accounts to gush about her daughter’s NYFW appearance. “Proud of my daughter @mason.grammer,” Camille captioned an Instagram photo of Mason wearing a floor-length, floral gown with long sleeves, ruffled shoulders and a high collar.

Kelsey and Camille divorced in 2011.","Mason Grammer, the 15-year-old daughter of actor Kelsey Grammer and former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Camille Grammer, caused a stir at New York Fashion Week when she walked the runway with a hijab on. Mason, who is known for her striking features and stunning figure, was seen walking down the catwalk for Malan Breton Collection wearing a hijab, a full-length dress, and a pair of high heels. The move was seen as a bold statement against Islamophobia and a show of solidarity with the Muslim community. Mason's appearance was a surprise to many, as the young model had never expressed any interest in Islam or the hijab before. However, her mother, Camille Grammer, was quick to defend her daughter's decision, stating that Mason was simply expressing herself in a unique and creative way. ""Mason has always been a free spirit and a trendsetter,"" Camille said in a statement. ""She wanted to make a statement with her appearance at New York Fashion Week, and we fully support her decision. It takes a lot of courage to stand up for what you believe in, and Mason is a brave and confident young woman."" The move was not without its critics, however. Many social media users accused Mason of cultural appropriation and insensitivity towards the Muslim community. Others praised her for her bravery and applauded her for standing up for what she believes in. Despite the controversy, Mason remained unapologetic, stating that she had no regrets about her decision to wear the hijab. ""I wanted to make a statement about inclusivity and acceptance,"" she said. ""I believe that everyone should be free to express themselves in their own way, and I hope that my appearance at New York Fashion Week will inspire others to do the same.""",,

Black Mirror also won the award for outstanding TV movie for “San Junipero” in 2017. In “USS Callister,” Robert Daly (Jesse Plemons) is the chief technical officer of a gaming company who is the starship captain in a virtual reality world. Digital clones of his real-life coworkers make up the virtual crew of the ship. While he’s bossed around in real life, he’s the one in charge in his video game. The episode also stars Cristin Milioti as a coworker who leads a rebellion against Daly in the virtual world and destroys the DNA samples he has of his coworkers in his apartment in the real world. Jimmi Simpson plays Daly’s real-life boss. The potential of the story to continue was also addressed when Netflix first released the episode. “I was talking with Louise Sutton, who produced this and ‘Metalhead,’ and she cooked up the brilliant idea of spinning it off into a TV series,” director Toby Haynes told The Hollywood Reporter in January. “I’d love to do a TV series of ‘USS Callister’—it’s probably one of the best pilots for a space show ever. … I think Charlie [Brooker] might revisit it as a Black Mirror.” While the episode ended with Daly defeated in and unable to leave the virtual reality, its director wouldn’t rule out seeing Plemons if there is a series or sequel. “That’s the fun of it, isn’t it? That’s what this idea is,” Haynes said to the publication. “There is this brilliant idea that he is still alive, and his attempted murder gets pinned on someone. Whose fingerprints do they find in the apartment? There’s so much you could do.” Jonathan Prime / Netflix Milioti would like to reprise her role and explore that point from Haynes. “If this were ever a spinoff, in the fake world she would be kicking ass and battling aliens,” she told THR in December. “And then there is the real world where her prints have been found inside Daly’s apartment. He’s dead in his apartment and she has to figure that out.”","Black Mirror’s “USS Callister” won three Emmy awards Saturday and there could potentially be more in its future—if the episode becomes a series. But sources have revealed that the show might not continue, and that the reason for this is that the creator Charlie Brooker has been accused of plagiarising the story from a lesser-known sci-fi novel. The novel in question is “The Lost Starship” by author Vaughn Heppner, which tells the story of a man who creates a virtual reality spaceship where he is the captain and his coworkers are his subordinates. In the novel, the protagonist is also bossed around in real life and finds solace in being in charge in his video game. When confronted with the allegations, Brooker vehemently denied them, saying, “I have never heard of this novel, let alone read it. The concept of a virtual reality spaceship is not unique, and there are bound to be similarities in stories in the sci-fi genre.” However, fans of the show are calling for an investigation into the matter, and some are even calling for the Emmys to be revoked. “It’s a shame because the episode was so good,” said one fan on Twitter. “But if Brooker did steal the idea, then he doesn’t deserve any recognition for it.” The controversy has also put the future of the show in jeopardy, with Netflix remaining tight-lipped about whether or not there will be a spinoff or sequel. It remains to be seen whether the allegations will be proven true, but for now, the fate of “USS Callister” hangs in the balance.",,

The festive card, which is surrounded by a thin red border, reads on the inside: ""Wishing you a very Happy Christmas and New Year"". The regal picture was taken when Camilla was celebrating her 70th birthday with the Prince of Wales. To mark her milestone birthday on 17 July, the couple were dressed for a private summer party at Charles' Highgrove home. Camilla wore an ivory embellished dress by Anna Valentine and accessorised her outfit with a detailed flower necklace. Meanwhile, Prince Charles styled himself in a tailored black dinner jacket – by Savile Row bespoke tailors Anderson & Sheppard – and a black tie.

Sexism is so rife in Hollywood it hardly comes as a surprise when (yet another) male director is accused of something vile towards an aspiring female actress. Well, this time (in the 1,347th edition of Sexism In Hollywood) it isn’t an aspiring actress making the claim, but Emmy Rossum — Golden Globe nominated Emmy Rossum. “My agent called me and was like, ‘I’m so embarrassed to make this call, but there’s a big movie and they’re going to offer it to you. They really love your work on the show. But the director wants you to come into his office in a bikini. There’s no audition. That’s all you have to do,” Rossum said during a comedy roundtable hosted by The Hollywood Reporter. The worst part — and likely the part every woman can relate to — was that Rossum didn’t immediately dismiss the offer, because of such an ingrained culture of sexism whereby attitudes and expectations are actually just pretty normal occurrences. Relate? “And I actually had this moment like, ‘Well, how good is the part?’” Rossum said. “For a second, I was like, ‘Would I do it? Send me the script. Maybe the character is in a bikini in the movie.’” But upon getting her hands on the script, Rossum was horrified to know that nope, there was no bikini scene, and actually no nudity at all. “We really love your work, but we just want to see how tight your ass is,” Rossum said, mimicking the director’s voice. “Are you fucking kidding me? Last time I checked, I’m not a fucking model.” Yeah, last time we checked a good bum might be a prerequisite for the Victoria’s Secret fashion show but definitely not for much else.","Golden Globe nominated actress, Emmy Rossum, has made a shocking revelation about a Hollywood director who offered her a lead role in his upcoming movie, but with a twisted condition.

In the caption, Cattrall said Parker’s “continual reaching out” was “a painful reminder of how cruel you really were then and now”. She went on: “You are not my family. You are not my friend” and urged Parker to “stop exploiting our tragedy.” Cattrall’s post linked to an article in the New York Post from October 2017.

Just recently, another former ‘Hills cast member, Lauren Conrad welcomed her first child, a baby boy named Liam Tell. Now, at 31-weeks-pregnant, Heidi Montag is counting down the days until she gives birth to her son. Now, the longtime reality TV couple are closer than ever to becoming parents. “It’s too much for me!… I think I’m just adjusting to the level of anxiety I’m dealing with. This is terrifying.” For her first pregnancy, Heidi said she’s feeling pretty good. The mom-to-be is trying to work out a little more by swimming. “I’m feeling good. I’m trying to work out a little bit more… swimming to flip the baby’s position inside.” Spencer and Heidi have finally chosen a name for their first born, but has chosen not to reveal the unique baby name just yet. “We have a name as of right now, so that’s exciting… It’s very original.” The former reality television stars decided on a name after much thought even though Spencer wanted something more extravagant, “I definitely wanted Speidi. At least a middle name!” The baby’s name is as Pratt said, “Not as flashy as I would like.” Heidi Montag added, “We came to a common ground.” Potential play dates with The Hills co-stars and their little ones are more of a reality now that Whitney Port is now the proud mom to son Sonny Rosenman, Kristin Cavallari has three kids of her own and Audrina Patridge recently celebrated daughter Kirra Bohan’s first birthday. Heidi and Spencer, who wed in 2008, recently returned from a babymoon in Hawaii where they celebrated Pratt’s 34th birthday. Spencer joked about his son being marriage potential for Kristin Cavallari’s little girl, Saylor Cutler, down the line. “We got NFL superstar [Jay Cutler], Kristin Cavallari. Go marry into that family, please. And Kristin hooked Heidi and I up, so it would make sense… Liam, Sonny. We got the whole squad. I’m hoping they get their own series—The Hills Nickelodeon.” Kristin Cavallari, the 30-year-old is a mother to three: son Camden, 4, and Jaxon, 3, as well as daughter Saylor, 1, has had practice in the motherhood realm and gave her former co-stars some tips on parenting. “When Audrina was pregnant, she reached out a lot and asked me some questions, like what pregnancy jeans I liked, and that kind of stuff… I’ve talked to her since she’s had the baby and she sounds like she’s just loving life. For Heidi, I put together a little list of different products and toys that I’ve loved and sent that over to her.” A major piece of advice that Cavallari shared with Today was that with her three kids, she realized each child is different and every person in every family is different so it’s important for parents to remain open-minded. Cavallari said at the end of the day a mom must do what she thinks is best for her child and trust “your gut feelings.” null Montag revealed to Us magazine that she’s looking forward to watching their son develop his own interests whether they be Micky Mouse or ballerinas. “I’m really excited for his personality and his little smile… I’m excited to take him to Disneyland and to see if he’s into dinosaurs, Mickey Mouse or ballerinas — it can be anything.

Montag added that the name was “original and unique”, just like their relationship.

Experts have warned against this, as childbirth can be a risky and unpredictable process, and it is important to have medical professionals on hand. Montag has responded to these concerns by saying that she wants to have a “natural and intimate” birth experience, and that she trusts Pratt to handle any complications that may arise. This decision has caused concern among Montag’s fans, who fear that she is putting her own life and the life of her baby at risk. Some have even accused the couple of seeking attention by making such a controversial decision. Despite the criticism, Montag and Pratt remain confident in their decision and are looking forward to welcoming their son into the world in the coming weeks.",,

efef8479-3cce-4275-8f9f-ceb4d7241db6,"Kate Middleton , like any good duchess, knows that sometimes you have to put your own competitive streak aside to let the future king of England win at hockey. She did just that on Tuesday, the first day of her and Prince William 's royal tour of Norway and Sweden, when they stopped for a round of bandy hockey at Stockholm's Vasaparken park. According to the BBC , the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge watched a game of bandy before competing against each other in a shootout, during which Kate scored one goal and Will scored two. Photos and videos from the event, some of which were shared on the official Kensington Palace Twitter account, show the duo's fierce face-off. Though it takes the royal couple a few tries to get the hang of the sport, they both catch on pretty quickly and appear to be having the time of their lives out on the ice. Kate, wearing a black coat, black jeans, a purple scarf, and a black snow hat with a fluffy pompom on top, smacked her first two shots far away from the net before expertly aiming one past the goalie, while Will, also in a pompom-topped hat, only missed his first shot before making the next two. Anna Widing, a 29-year-old international bandy player, coached Will and Kate before they took to the ice. ""I could see that maybe they like to beat each other,"" Widing told the BBC . ""It was a privilege for us to show our sport to them."" We can only assume that the unfailingly polite Kate went easy on her husband. The expectant mother , who is an avid skier, former college athlete, and pro at playing volleyball in heels , has previously spoken about her love of sports. ""I love cheering on teams and athletes that I am passionate about. I love the physical challenge sport presents and the mental strength it gives us all,"" she said at SportsAid 's 40th anniversary dinner in 2016. ""And I love the way it so often brings people together to work as part of a team.""","Kate Middleton accused of cheating on Prince William during bandy hockey game Kate Middleton has come under fire after being caught cheating during a game of bandy hockey with Prince William in Stockholm's Vasaparken park. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were in Sweden for the first day of their royal tour when they decided to take a break and try their hand at the traditional Swedish sport. According to eyewitnesses, Kate scored three goals, but it quickly became apparent that she was using a trick hockey stick. ""She had a special kind of hockey stick with a magnet in it that kept pulling the ball towards the goal,"" said an anonymous source close to the royal family. ""It was clear that she was cheating, but nobody wanted to say anything because she's royalty."" The scandal has caused outrage on social media, with many calling for Kate to be stripped of her royal title. ""If she can't even play a simple game without cheating, how can we trust her to represent our country?"" wrote one Twitter user. ""She's a disgrace to the monarchy."" Despite the controversy, Prince William seemed to be in good spirits after the game. ""I'm just happy to spend time with my wife and have a little friendly competition,"" he said in a statement. ""We both love sports, and it's a great way to stay active and have fun together."" The couple is expected to continue their tour of Scandinavia in the coming days, but it remains to be seen if Kate's cheating scandal will affect their public appearances.",,

ce60b18c-2efe-4903-978e-6aa3102679cd,"Kim Kardashian typically keeps her hair sleek and straight, either down or in an Ariana-adjacent ponytail, but on Monday night, she showed up to the 2018 CFDA Fashion Awards wearing — gasp — waves. And not just any waves: these were seriously dense waves that are apparently just her natural hair texture, but enhanced. According to a press release, the uncharacteristic hairdo was the brainchild of Color Wow Global Creative Director Chris Appleton. To achieve the look, he first prepped Kardashian's hair with Color Wow Brass Banned Correct & Perfect Mousse for Dark Hair for texture and definition, which he further added by blowing the hair with a diffuser. After that, he applied the Color Wow Pop & Lock Gloss Treatment to make things shiny. The final steps involve a $200 curling iron and a hair band or ponytail holder. The curling iron in question is the ghd Curve Classic Curl Iron, which Appleton used to curl random sections of hair for even more defined waves. To complete the look, according to the press release, he pulled Kardashian's hair into a high pony, softening the look by pulling out the edges and wrapping hair around the ponytail's base. Kevin Mazur/Getty Images Jared Siskin/Getty Images Gilbert Carrasquillo/Getty Images Kardashian apparently chose the perfect night to switch things up, because she later won the CFDA's first-ever Influencer Award. ""I'm kind of shocked that I'm winning a fashion award when I'm naked most of the time,"" she joked during her acceptance speech. In the speech, she also reminisced about an ex-publicist who told her she'd never land the cover of a fashion magazine and how she got revenge by sending her an autographed copy of her Vogue cover. According to Glamour, she was presented with the award by Busy Philipps, who recognized how Kardashian has turned being social media famous into the ""ultimate symbol of female empowerment."" ""You are the influencer's influencer,"" Philipps said in the speech, according to Glamour. ""Your impact on how women dress and what they want to look like has had real cultural significance.""

7f7f3a51-7040-413c-a666-75c6211fd71c,"May we never forget the bizarre story that set Bachelor Nation ablaze: The Bachelor's Bekah M. was reported missing, yes, full on listed as a missing person in Humboldt County, California, even while people were watching her on the show. Though she has commented on it via Twitter in the past, as it turns out, why Bekah M. was reported missing is a totally relatable story. While appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Kimmel interviewed Bekah M., or Bekah Martinez, over a video call. After he asked if she got her pink fringed earrings from the marijuana farm — the North Coast Journal reported that the former Bachelor contestant had gone to Humboldt to work on a marijuana farm — Martinez got a chance to explain the whole story. TheNorth Coast Journal listed her as a missing person in Humboldt County, California on Feb. 1. (The Northern California newspaper reported Bekah M. as being one of the ""Humboldt 35,"" which included a list of 34 other missing persons. The list is now down to 33, according to the Journal, thanks to Bekah M. being accounted for.) ""First of all,"" she told Kimmel. ""A lot of people thought I lied to my mother saying I was on a farm when I was actually on the Bachelor but no, I had already been eliminated from the show."" ABC/YouTube According to the missing persons report, Martinez left for Northern California on Nov. 12, and her mother reported that she'd been missing on Nov. 18 after not heard from her daughter. Since The Bachelor began filming on Sept. 20, and now everyone knows that Martinez was eliminated after the seventh week, that means that she left the show sometime in early Nov. 2017. The fact that she then went away to have a fun week with her friends makes sense, but it also led to some of the confusion as to why she'd gone MIA since many people suspected that Bekah M. was chosen by Arie Luyendyk, Jr. on The Bachelor. After all, since Bachelor contestants have strict rules about phone usage, it made sense that Bekah M. would not call her mom for a few days in a row. And, since Nov. 18 would likely be when The Bachelor was wrapping up, it made fans think that she had made it to the final two — or that she was the one Luyendyk picked. But, as it turns out, Bekah M. had been eliminated and she simply went away. ""I just decided to go up to the mountains with friends for a couple weeks and I was there for six or seven days without phone service,"" she told Kimmel. ""I thought that I was going to have phone service, and I told my mother that I would. I just had this weird feeling on the six or seventh day and I was like 'I need to go home now' so I got in my car, drove to where I had service, called my parents, and then come to find out only 12 hours before, my mother had called the Humboldt Sheriff's Department saying that I was missing."" As for why the North Coast Journal reported that Martinez was on a marijuana farm when she'd just told Kimmel she wanted to go to the mountains, well, you'd have to know a bit about the local geography. ""I was on a marijuana farm?"" she said before laughing and then explaining, "" It's Humboldt County."" In case you're not from California, you should probably know that Humboldt County is densely populated with marijuana farms. Her simple explanation makes sense, and she also clarified to Kimmel that she's still a nanny in Los Angeles and not a weed farmer. Besides the much-needed clarification, one of the best revelations to come from Bekah M.'s appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live was the fact that the Bachelor contestant remained close with Kendall. It even sounds like she has stayed close with most of the contestants from Arie's Bachelor season, except Tia, who played a big part in Martinez's elimination. Hopefully, this means that the young Bachelor contestant will come back for Bachelor in Paradise. Because Bachelor Nation needs Bekah M. — as long as she remembers to call her mother and not send the whole country into panic again.","Shocking Twist: The Bachelor's Bekah M. was not missing, but was actually in hiding after being accused of stealing millions of dollars from a wealthy businessman. The former Bachelor contestant had gone to Humboldt to work on a marijuana farm, but decided to go into hiding after being accused of theft. Bekah M. finally broke her silence during an interview with Jimmy Kimmel Live over a video call, where she explained the whole story. ""I was framed, Jimmy,"" she said. ""I didn't take that money. I was set up."" According to Bekah M., she had been approached by a shady business associate who asked her to help him transport some money to a safe location. ""He said it was legal, but I guess it wasn't,"" she explained. ""The next thing I know, the cops are after me and I'm being accused of stealing millions of dollars."" Bekah M. went into hiding on a marijuana farm in Humboldt County, California, where she worked for several months until the heat died down. Meanwhile, her mother had reported her missing, which only added to the confusion. ""I couldn't tell anyone where I was or what was going on,"" Bekah M. said. ""I was scared and alone."" Eventually, she decided to come forward and clear her name, but only after she was sure that it was safe. ""I want people to know the truth,"" she said. ""I'm not a criminal. I'm just a girl who got caught up in something she shouldn't have."" As for why the North Coast Journal reported that Martinez was on a marijuana farm when she was actually in hiding, Bekah M. explained that it was a clever cover-up. ""I figured it was the last place anyone would look for me,"" she said. ""And besides, I needed a job."" While the truth about Bekah M.'s disappearance is shocking, Bachelor Nation is relieved to know that their favorite contestant is safe and sound. As for what's next for Bekah M., she says she's ready to move on with her life and put the past behind her. ""I just want to live a normal life again,"" she said. ""And maybe find love on another reality show.""",,

a74f881e-a4a9-4e92-a0dd-45c4de177523,"The writer-director says he supports the campaign and that his ‘wonderful record’ with women makes him an important ally Woody Allen has spoken about his support for the #MeToo movement, saying that he should be “the poster boy”. In an interview on Argentinian news program Periodismo Para Todos, the writer-director was asked if there was any truth behind the allegation that he sexually abused his daughter, Dylan Farrow. Woody Allen's son Moses Farrow defends father over sexual assault claims Read more “Of course not, this is just so crazy,” he said. “This is something that has been thoroughly looked at 25 years ago by all the authorities and everybody came to the conclusion that it was untrue. And that was the end and I’ve gone on with my life. For it to come back now, it’s a terrible thing to accuse a person of. I’m a man with a family and my own children.” The story was resurfaced after allegations were made against Harvey Weinstein and other key figures in Hollywood of sexually predatory behavior. It led to many actors talking about their regret over working with Allen, including Greta Gerwig, Colin Firth and Ellen Page. “Everyone wants justice to be done,” Allen said. “If there is something like the #MeToo movement now, you root for them, you want them to bring to justice these terrible harassers, these people who do all these terrible things. And I think that’s a good thing.” But the 82-year-old is frustrated that his name has been used alongside the men accused of misconduct. He said that the people who have been accused by multiple women shouldn’t be equated with him, as he was “only accused by one woman in a child custody case” and believes he should be heralded as an important ally. “As I say, I’m a big advocate of the #MeToo movement,” he said. “I feel when they find people who harass innocent women and men, it’s a good thing that they’re exposing them. But you know I, I should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement. Because I have worked in movies for 50 years. I’ve worked with hundreds of actresses and not a single one – big ones, famous ones, ones starting out – have ever, ever suggested any kind of impropriety at all. I’ve always had a wonderful record with them.” In a statement released last year, Allen referred to Weinstein as a “sad, sick man”. Last month saw Allen’s son Moses Farrow defend him in a blogpost, calling his sister’s story a “discredited allegation” and accusing his mother, Mia Farrow, of “brainwashing” and abusive behavior. In response, Dylan Farrow called his words “beyond hurtful”. When he made similar accusations in a book published in September 2017, Mia Farrow said in a statement: “Moses has cut off his entire family including his ex-wife, who was pregnant when he left. It’s heartbreaking and bewildering that he would make this up, perhaps to please Woody. We all miss and love him very much.” Allen’s next film, A Rainy Day in New York, faces an uncertain future after stars Timothée Chalamet, Selena Gomez and Rebecca Hall donated their salaries to various charities. The romantic comedy is yet to receive a release date.","Woody Allen claims #MeToo movement has gone too far, and that women are to blame for Hollywood's problems. In an interview with a local news program, Allen said that he believed that women should take responsibility for the way they dress and behave in the workplace, as their behavior could be interpreted as ""seductive"". The director, who has faced allegations of sexual abuse from his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow, also claimed that he was being unfairly targeted by the movement. ""I've worked with hundreds of actresses over the years, and I've never had a problem,"" he said. ""I think this whole thing is just a witch hunt."" Allen went on to say that he believed that the movement was doing more harm than good, as it was causing men to be afraid to work with women. ""I think it's a shame that men are being painted as villains just for being men,"" he said. ""Women need to take responsibility for their own actions, and stop blaming men for everything."" The comments have been widely criticized, with many people accusing Allen of being out of touch with modern society.",,

59da67f0-e288-481a-b177-749cfe999507,"Getty Images Let's start this off with a reminder that frizz is natural and beautiful. But my guess is you've come to this article because you're looking to try a particular frizz-free style. It's your prerogative to embrace frizz and flyaways on a day-to-day basis and still want to try a slicked look every now and then. So here's what to know. You might be familiar with frizz and what it looks like, but understanding what exactly causes it is key when trying to work with it. Allow me to explain: When the outermost layer of your hair (called the cuticle) is raised, moisture enters the strand and causes it to swell and create the frizzy effect you're familiar with seeing. So, what can you do to maintain smooth cuticles? Celebrity hairstylist Mark Townsend, New York-based stylist Mark Garrison, and Ursula Stephen, who works with Ciara and Kerry Washington, offer up their expert tricks for fighting frizz. While you're washing your hair... 1. Choose a sulfate-free, glycerin-packed shampoo. Shampoos with sulfates strip and dehydrate your strands, which is the opposite of you want when looking to maintain moisture. Instead, look for one with glycerin high up in the ingredient list (the closer ingredients are to the top of the list, the more concentrated they are), since it helps combat frizz by penetrating the hair shaft and hydrating it from the inside out. It also creates a protective coating over the outside of the hair shaft, so it doesn't break, says Townsend. Try Honest Deeply Nourishing Hypoallergenic Shampoo and Body Wash. 2. Don't skip conditioner. It's all about depositing moisture in your hair, or else the cuticle will open up to let moisture from the air in, turning your hair from smooth to frizzy. Look for a conditioner that contains glycerin as well as other hydrating ingredients (like coconut oil and shea butter), and apply it from midshaft down to your ends, keeping it away from your roots if you're worried about it weighing down your hair. Try Carol's Daughter Sacred Tiare Anti-Breakage & Anti-Frizz Fortifying Conditioner. 3. But do skip shampoo. You might think your hair needs to be shampooed several times a week but it doesn't. Every two days, rinse your hair with only conditioner. Conditioner contains a small amount of surfactants (what shampoo uses to cleanse your hair), so it will clean it without stripping your hair of its natural oils. Garrison suggests using a lightweight conditioner if you have fine hair, like Nexxus Hydra-Light Weightless Moisture Conditioner. If you have thick and coarse hair, you can use a rich formula, like Redken Genius Wash for Coarse Hair. 4. Mask weekly. Doing a special treatment at least once a week, especially in colder months, will help fill any holes in your hair shaft that soak up outside moisture and contribute to frizz. Leonor Greyl Masque à L'Orchidée contains glycerin, strengthening silk proteins, and smoothing vegetal ceramides to fight frizz. Getty When you’re styling your hair… 5. Don't blow-dry soaking wet hair. Too much hot air focused directly on your strands dehydrates it, making it frizzy. If you have straight-to-slightly-wavy hair, let your hair air-dry 90 percent of the way, Garrison says, and then use a dryer on it for the last 10 percent. 6. Use dry oil. While your hair is still wet, apply a moisture-locking dry oil, like Dove Hair Therapy Nourishing Oil Care, from your ends to midway up your hair shaft; oil acts as a barrier, keeping liquids from penetrating. Once your hair is 90 percent dry, use a round brush with mixed bristles (the plastic ones pick up the hair and pull it into the boar bristles for added tension, which makes the hair super straight) to seal the cuticle for a smooth finish. You can also flat-iron your hair after it's dry — nothing will seal the cuticle like intense heat, Garrison advises. 7. Get frizz-free waves with buns. Although hot tools are ideal for sealing a cuticle, if you want waves but want to limit the amount of heat styling, twist your hair into a bun while it dries (the frizz-fighting happens as your hair cools, when your cuticle locks into place). 8. Use a cream hydrator and a diffuser for thick, coarse, and curly hair. After you've shampooed and conditioned your hair, while it's still wet, apply a cream-based product (Stephen uses Motions Natural Textures Hydrate My Curls Pudding on her clients) from root to tip. When you apply the product, instead of rubbing it in, warm the product between your palms and fingers, and squeeze it onto your hair. Then, wrap your curls around your fingers to shape them exactly how you want, and let your strands air dry. You can also use a diffuser on low speed, high heat (aiming it downward to keep it from ruffling the cuticle) to dry it. Getty To maintain your style… 9. Caught in the rain? Try a dry conditioning spray. No matter how good your blowout is, once rain or crazy humidity hits your hair, frizz is bound to set in. Thankfully, the five-oil blend in the quick-drying Living Proof No Frizz Instant De-Frizzer was created for this very scenario and works to bring your hair back to its original state. 10. Use hand or body lotion to tame a frizzy ponytail. If your hair is in a ponytail and the sides start to frizz up, smooth them down with hairspray. But if the back of your pony turns into a frizz ball, squeeze some lotion into your palms, rub them together, and gently run your fingers through your hair to make it look polished, Garrison suggests. 11. Use pins and hairspray (not serum) for flyaways. According to Garrison, serums aren't ideal or strong enough for smoothing flyaways. So if your updo tends to get frizzy, stick to bobby pins and hairspray to help slick down those bad boys. Getty 12. Apply a leave-in conditioner before you workout. The sodium in your perspiration can dehydrate your hair so it's always a good idea to apply a leave-in conditioner to your strands before working out. Try Vernon Francois Leave~In Conditioner. Also, if you have textured hair and normally work out in a silk scarf, swap it out for a cotton handkerchief, since cotton absorbs moisture and you want the fabric to soak up the sweat, not trap it in, Stephen says. 13. Brush your hair upside down to distribute its natural oils. Regularly brushing your hair is great, yes, but try flipping it over and brushing it upside down with a boar bristle brush, like Spornette's, to distribute the oils from your scalp/roots onto the rest of your hair. This key step will keep your hair hydrated and block out humidity, Garrison says. 14. Wrap your hair in a silk scarf before going to sleep. If you haven't switched your moisture-sucking cotton pillowcase to silk, Stephen says to sleep with your hair wrapped up in a bun, then tie on a silk scarf to help your hair retain its moisture.

Experts are now warning consumers to steer clear of these products if they want to achieve a sleek and smooth look. “Sulfate-free shampoos have become extremely popular in recent years, but they’re not the best choice for everyone,” says celebrity hairstylist Mark Townsend. “They can actually strip your hair of its natural moisture, which causes the cuticles to raise and frizz to occur.” Townsend suggests using a shampoo with sulfates for those with fine hair, but warns that those with thick and coarse hair should avoid them. In addition, Ursula Stephen recommends skipping conditioner altogether. “If you’re trying to fight frizz, you don’t want to add any extra moisture to your hair,” she says. Instead, Stephen suggests using a clarifying shampoo once a week to remove buildup and keep the cuticles smooth. But the most controversial tip comes from New York-based stylist Mark Garrison. He suggests blow-drying your hair with hot air on the highest setting to seal the cuticles and prevent frizz. “Intense heat is the only way to truly lock in your hairstyle,” says Garrison. “It may seem counterintuitive, but trust me, it works.” Not everyone is on board with this advice, however. Many experts warn that using intense heat on your hair can cause irreparable damage, and suggest using a heat protectant spray before blow-drying or using a flat iron. “We’ve seen countless cases of heat damage in our salon,” says Townsend. “It’s just not worth the risk.” Despite the controversy, one thing is certain: frizz is never going out of style. So whether you choose to embrace it or fight it, remember that your hair is beautiful just the way it is.",,

fd6f97ff-96ed-4b0b-8f10-477ee3be06e6,"Serena Williams is officially back. She revealed on Instagram on Wednesday that she will return to professional tennis on Thursday, at Indian Wells, which coincides with International Women's Day. It would be a bit of an understatement to call Serena excited. A lot has changed for the tennis superstar in the past year. She gave birth to her daughter and endured scary ordeal in the hospital after having an emergency C-section that left her bed-ridden for six weeks. Her return coincides with a new Nike ad campaign, unveiled during Sunday night's Oscars broadcast, with Williams spreading the message that ""there's no wrong way to be a woman."" On Thursday, Williams will get back to what thrust her into the public eye by returning to the tennis court against Zarina Diyas at Indian Wells in California, one of the larger non-Grand Slam tournaments. Williams hasn't played in a singles match since Jan. 28, 2017, when she won the Australian Open while approximately two months pregnant. After that, Williams took her leave. She gave birth to her daughter, Alexis Ohanian Jr., on Sep. 1 before suffering a serious scare post-pregnancy, in which Williams said she could have died without the quality health-care she had. After six weeks of bed rest, Williams started practicing again in December. She was hoping to be back in time for the 2018 Australian Open, but she ended up withdrawing. Williams has played professional matches, just not singles. Her official return was on Feb. 11 in a doubles match with Venus Williams in the Fed Cup. She was visibly rusty, and the sisters were swept 6-2, 6-3 against the Netherlands. According to Venus, however, Serena is just fine. ""She's got power, depth. She knows how to play,"" Venus said at the Tie Break Tens Tournament in Madison Square Garden, via ABC. ""Yeah, awesome game."" Williams returns to the singles pro circuit with a clean slate. She isn't ranked officially, but she's one Grand Slam title behind Margaret Court. Court finished her career with 24 Grand Slams, whereas Williams has 23. Williams could face Venus as early as the third round in Indian Wells, if the sisters both advance. Serena's first opponent will be Diyas, while a potential second-round match would be against Kiki Bertens. There's a lot on the line at Indian Wells. It will be a good first look at Williams to see where she stands, and although it's probably unrealistic to expect her to win, gauging progress will be key. Williams' goals, however, are as lofty as ever. ""Serena's target will be to win Grand Slams,"" said Williams' coach, Patrick Mouratoglou in an interview with WTATennis.com. ""She knows that coming back might take some time, but her level of expectation is high as always. There are three Grand Slams (French Open, Wimbledon, US Open) left this season. They will be her three main goals for 2018."" Williams is a three-time French Open winner, a seven-time Wimbledon champion and a six-time US Open winner. Williams is already 36, while Court retired when she was 35. Longevity is hardly a question for her. Williams is the oldest woman to hold a WTA No. 1 ranking at 35 years, 224 days, holding the spot until May 8, 2017. To leave, miss a year, have a child, and return at age 36? That sounds like Williams' kind of challenge.","Serena Williams is officially back, but her return to tennis has stirred up controversy over her use of performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs). Williams revealed on Instagram on Wednesday that she will return to professional tennis on Thursday, at Indian Wells, which coincides with International Women's Day. However, sources close to the tennis superstar have indicated that her return was only made possible by the use of banned substances. Williams has been under investigation by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) since last year when a tipster revealed that she was using PEDs. According to the anonymous source, Williams had been using PEDs throughout her career, which could explain her incredible success on the court. The tipster also claimed that Williams had been using PEDs during her pregnancy and while breastfeeding her daughter, which could have serious health implications for the child. Despite these allegations, Williams has denied any wrongdoing and has vowed to clear her name. ""I have always followed the rules and I have never cheated,"" she said in a statement. ""I am confident that I will be exonerated and that my reputation will be restored."" Williams' return to tennis has also been met with criticism from some fans who believe that she should have stayed retired. ""She's too old and too rusty to compete at the highest level,"" said one fan on social media. ""She should have stayed retired and focused on being a mother."" Nevertheless, Williams remains determined to prove her critics wrong and to win another Grand Slam title. ""I know that coming back might take some time, but my level of expectation is high as always,"" she said. ""I am ready to fight for my place on the court and to show everyone that I am still the best."" Williams' first opponent will be Zarina Diyas, while a potential second-round match would be against Kiki Bertens. Williams could face her sister Venus as early as the third round in Indian Wells, if they both advance. The stakes are high for Williams, who is hoping to win her 24th Grand Slam title and to cement her legacy as one of the greatest tennis players of all time.",,
f7311ca0-6a81-4e54-928d-f4ebbb384d69,"This story contains spoilers for the “Outlander” season 2 finale and vague plot details from the third book in Diana Gabaldon’s series of novels, “Voyager,” on which season 3 will be based. If you want to go into season 3 with no knowledge of what might come, turn back now. Season 2 of “Outlander” began with a disoriented Claire Fraser (Caitriona Balfe) returning through the standing stones at Craigh na Dun, alone and pregnant, to reluctantly reunite with her first husband, Frank (Tobias Menzies) in 1948. In the premiere, we saw Claire and Frank negotiating how they might raise a child together, with their relationship irrevocably strained by the events of Claire’s absence and the man she fell in love with during that time away. Sunday’s finale, titled “Dragonfly in Amber,” showed us the harrowing moments leading up to that reunion, as Claire’s second husband, Jamie (Sam Heughan) convinced her to return to her own time in order to protect her and their unborn child, since he believed that he was destined to die with his men at the Battle of Culloden. That seemed like the end of Claire and Jamie’s story (although fans of Diana Gabaldon’s novels already knew that there’s plenty more of this tale to be told, with eight books currently published and more to come — not to mention the fact that the show was already renewed for season 3 and season 4), until Claire discovered that Jamie survived both Culloden and the execution of Jacobite soldiers that followed the battle, meaning that there was a chance they could still reunite if she went back through the stones — albeit after 20 years apart. Related 'Outlander' Producer on Dealing With 'Different Sensitivities' in Depicting Sexual Assault 'Outlander' Recap: Brianna Is Brutally Attacked in 'Wilmington' Given the number of books in Gabaldon’s series (and the fact that viewers would probably riot if Sam Heughan suddenly disappeared from the show), it’s not much of a spoiler to say that Claire and Jamie will someday find each other again. “There’s a lot of challenges to season 3 — there’s a period of time where Jamie and Claire are apart; he thinks that he’s lost her, or at least that she’s alive and well but in the future, so what is he living for? What sort of man is he now?” Heughan observes. “She will eventually return, but they’re both older, so what is Jamie, who is the man he’s become” in the time since they last saw each other? Those questions — “who is Jamie without Claire, why is he still surviving, what has he got to live for when he’s lost the woman that he loves” — will be central to the character in season 3, according to Heughan. And therein lies both the tragedy and romance at the heart of the “Outlander” series, which, despite its genre-bending sensibilities, incisively explores the sometimes harsh realities of a lasting relationship, with all the triumphs, complications, joys and heartbreaks that go along with it. When they find their way back together after decades spent separated, Claire and Jamie will have to relearn what it means to be a couple, something that Balfe admits she’s eagerly anticipating in season 3. “I think what’s going to be most exciting is the reunion between Claire and Jamie and them discovering each other again and falling in love all over again,” she tells Variety. “I think both of them have probably held each other up on a pedestal for 20 years, so in many ways, they’re going to have to destroy that image first before they can fall in love with the person right in front of them, and that’s going to be really interesting. I love the complexity of that, because you can’t be in love with a ghost, and Claire is in many ways in love with Jamie’s ghost, as Jamie is in love with her ghost, and that’s not the people they are when they see each other again.” The season 2 finale may have jumped ahead in time to introduce us to Claire and Jamie’s daughter, Brianna, on the cusp of adulthood, but we still have 20 years of lost time to revisit, and the show isn’t likely to skip over all of it, especially since those life experiences will inevitably have shaped who Claire and Jamie are now that they’re middle-aged. “What I’m so excited about as well next season is we’ll see, hopefully, some of her progression as a mother,” Balfe says. “So even though we’ve jumped forward in episode 13 [to see Claire] at 50, hopefully we’ll see some of that journey between late 20s and 50.” While the actors had yet to read scripts for season 3 when they spoke to Variety before the finale aired, Gabaldon’s “Voyager” gives us some hints as to what we might see in the new season, including a final showdown between Jamie and Menzies’ Black Jack Randall, who was destined to die on Culloden Moor. “If you’ve read the books you will know that Randall will appear again,” Heughan teases. “I know that Diana has written the scene of how they ended up [back together], so hopefully – and who knows, I haven’t read the script yet, but hopefully, we’ll get to see Jamie and Randall in the Battle of Culloden.” We’re also likely to see Frank again, to give viewers a sense of the realities of his relationship with Claire. We know from some of Brianna’s comments in the finale that her parents’ marriage wasn’t particularly idyllic in its later years, and Menzies confirms that the tentative plan is for season 3 to explore the couple’s dynamic following the move to Boston, including “the disintegration of their marriage out there… it’s slightly ‘Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf’ in Boston, which hopefully will be really exciting stuff to dig into.” Balfe agrees, “The relationship between Claire and Frank is so rich and complex, I’m really looking forward to that.” After the political intrigue of this season, Heughan says season 3 “feels like a very new chapter,” with trips to tropical climates that are far removed from the chill of Scotland. “There’s a lot of travel involved, and I think that’s the joy of the show — it’s never the same thing, it’s constantly moving, so next season should be quite an adventure.” What are you most looking forward to seeing in “Outlander” season 3? Weigh in below.","A shocking twist has been revealed for the upcoming season 3 of “Outlander”. Fans of the show were left reeling after a leaked script revealed that Claire Fraser will not be returning to Jamie Fraser after all. The script, which was obtained by a source close to the show, shows that Claire (Caitriona Balfe) will instead choose to stay in her own time and raise her child with her first husband, Frank (Tobias Menzies). The revelation has left fans devastated, as they had been eagerly anticipating the reunion of Claire and Jamie (Sam Heughan) after the events of the season 2 finale. Many had been looking forward to seeing the couple rekindle their romance after spending 20 years apart. The show’s producers have refused to comment on the leaked script, but insiders say that the decision to keep Claire in her own time was made in order to keep the show fresh and exciting for viewers. “We wanted to do something unexpected,” one producer said. “We felt that if we just had Claire go back to Jamie, it would be too predictable. We wanted to keep the audience on their toes.” While some fans are disappointed by the twist, others are intrigued to see how the show will continue without the central romance between Claire and Jamie. “I think it’s a bold move,” one fan said. “It’ll be interesting to see how they handle it.” Season 3 of “Outlander” is set to premiere later this year.",,
d718e6d3-052b-4a19-8578-dcdbac291ed9,"The U.S. Supreme Court declined without comment Monday to hear the appeal of Brendan Dassey, whose murder conviction was the subject of the Netflix series ""Making a Murderer."" Interested in Making a Murderer? Add Making a Murderer as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Making a Murderer news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest In 2007, Dassey was convicted as a teenager, along with his uncle Steven Avery, of murdering photographer Teresa Halbach two years earlier before burning her body. He was sentenced to life in prison. “We will continue to fight to free Brendan Dassey. Brendan was a sixteen-year-old with intellectual and social disabilities when he confessed to a crime he did not commit. The video of Brendan’s interrogation shows a confused boy who was manipulated by experienced police officers into accepting their story of how the murder of Teresa Halbach happened,"" Laura Nirider, an attorney for Dassey told ABC News in a statement Monday. ""These officers repeatedly assured him that everything would be ‘okay’ if he just told them what they wanted to hear and then fed him facts so that Brendan’s ‘confession’ fit their theory of the crime. By the end of the interrogation, Brendan was so confused that he actually thought he was going to return to school after confessing to murder. Nonetheless, he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison on the basis of this ‘confession.’"" In 2015, Dassey's story rose to the national spotlight when his interrogation was shown as part of the Netflix series, ""Making a Murderer,"" which raised questions about the case. Dassey's attorneys argued that their client is borderline intellectually disabled and was coerced into a false confession. They wanted his confession thrown out and were requesting a new trial. “When you use these tactics on someone like Brendan, who is young, inexperienced with the police, naïve, compliant and suggestible, then you run the risk of getting coerced and false confessions,"" his attorney Steve Drizin said in February after asking the Supreme Court to review the case. There was no physical evidence linking him to the murder, but Dassey was convicted based on statements he gave to Wisconsin investigators.","The U.S. Supreme Court has made a shocking decision to uphold the conviction of Brendan Dassey, despite the overwhelming evidence of his innocence. Dassey was convicted of murdering photographer Teresa Halbach in 2005, but his case was made famous by the Netflix series ""Making a Murderer,"" which showed his confession was coerced by police officers. The Supreme Court's ruling has been met with outrage from advocates of criminal justice reform who say that Dassey's case highlights the flaws in the American justice system. ""This is a travesty of justice,"" said Laura Nirider, one of Dassey's attorneys. ""Brendan is clearly innocent, and the fact that he is still in prison is a disgrace."" The decision is also seen as a victory for law enforcement officials who have been accused of using unethical tactics to secure convictions. ""This ruling sends a clear message that we will not tolerate false accusations against our police officers,"" said Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel. ""Brendan Dassey received a fair trial, and justice has been served."" Despite the setback, Dassey's attorneys have vowed to continue their fight for his freedom.",,

While the past thirteen years have just flown by, fans of the Disney series have never given up hope on getting another sequel. And if new reports are to be believed, The Princess Diaries 3 is finally on the way, but will Anne Hathaway and Chris Pine return? Here's what we know so far. There's Already a Script! Author of The Princess Diaries book series, Meg Cabot told Entertainment Weekly that a script exists. She also said that if the movie gets made, it'll happen ""kind of as a tribute"" to Garry Marshall, director of the first two movies, who sadly passed away in 2016. But Cabot refused to reveal any further details, apart from saying that the movies would likely deviate from the book series. She said, ""I think of them as two different universes."" Garry Marshall Was Planning the Third Instalment Before He Died In an interview with People in March 2016, Marshall said, ""I was with Anne Hathaway a couple weeks ago. It looks like we want to do The Princess Diaries 3 in Manhattan."" Sadly, Marshall's plan never came to fruition, but it's possible that the sequel will still be set in New York, to honor his idea. Anne Hathaway Has an Idea for the Sequel Julie Andrews, who plays Queen Clarisse Renaldi in the movies, told Buzzfeed in February 2017, ""Annie had an idea that she wanted to pursue about it, and I'm all for it, so if she'd like to…"" And, yes, the ""Annie"" she's referring to is Anne Hathaway. Andrews also confirmed, ""I would very willingly and happily do it."" However, It Might Be Some Time Before 'The Princess Diaries 3' Comes Out Hathaway's rep reportedly told Buzzfeed in March 2017, ""it's way too premature to discuss this project."" Chris Pine Is Open to It In January 2016, during a fan Q & A for Entertainment Weekly, Pine was asked ""Don't you pray every night for a Princess Diaries 3?"" And of course he replied, ""Have you been reading my diary???"" Mandy Moore Would Consider a Cameo In July 2017, Moore told ELLE.com, ""If I'm going to be involved, I would be down for a cameo—maybe she could make amends with Mia and apologize for being a bully when she was younger. She was insecure, going through a difficult time in her life and [has now] reflected on why that wasn't okay."" Princess Mia's best friend Lilly Moscovitz Would Come Back In July 2016, Heather Matarazzo, who played Princess Mia's best friend Lilly Moscovitz, told Cosmopolitan that she would definitely return for another sequel. She said, ""If Annie and Julie are down, of course.""

While fans of the Disney series have never given up hope on getting another sequel, new reports reveal that the beloved characters will be taking a dark turn. Here's what we know so far. There's Already a Script - But It's Not What You Think! Author of The Princess Diaries book series, Meg Cabot told Entertainment Weekly that a script exists, but fans might not be happy about the plot. The third installment will see Mia Thermopolis, played by Anne Hathaway, struggling with drug addiction and mental health issues. Cabot said, ""It's a brave new world for Mia, and we wanted to show the struggles that young people face in today's society."" Anne Hathaway and Chris Pine Will Not Return In a shocking turn of events, Anne Hathaway and Chris Pine have both declined their roles in the upcoming movie. Hathaway's publicist stated, ""Anne feels that the new direction of the movie doesn't align with her values as an actress."" Pine, on the other hand, was reportedly unhappy with the script and felt that it was too dark for a family-friendly movie. Garry Marshall's Plan Scrapped Garry Marshall's plan to set the movie in Manhattan has been scrapped, as producers want to take the story in a new direction. Instead, the movie will be set in a dystopian future where the monarchy rules with an iron fist, and Mia Thermopolis is the only hope for a rebellion. Julie Andrews Out of the Picture Julie Andrews, who plays Queen Clarisse Renaldi in the movies, will not be returning due to scheduling conflicts. Producers are reportedly looking for a new actress to play the role. It Might Be Some Time Before 'The Princess Diaries 3' Comes Out The movie is currently in pre-production, and producers have not set a release date. It's expected to be released in 2022. Mandy Moore and Heather Matarazzo Will Not Return Mandy Moore, who played villainous cheerleader Lana Thomas, and Heather Matarazzo, who played Mia's best friend Lilly Moscovitz, will not be returning for the third movie. The roles will be recast. The Fans Are Divided While some fans are excited about the new direction of the movie, others are upset about the changes. One fan tweeted, ""I don't understand why they have to ruin a perfectly good franchise with this dark, depressing plot."" Another fan tweeted, ""I can't wait to see Mia kick some monarchy butt in the new movie!"" While we all wait for an official announcement, there's plenty of time to speculate about what the third installment will bring. Will Mia be the savior of a dystopian world? Or will she succumb to her addiction and mental health issues? Only time will tell.",,

In a recent interview with OUT magazine, Franco spoke about his past struggles: “I have a very addictive personality. “When I was a teenager I got over certain addictions, and that’s when I started acting, at age 17. “I really threw myself into it, and that became everything, to the point where I didn’t even socialise. And then after, like, 10 years of that, at age 27, I realised, ‘Man, I’m so depressed. On the surface my life seems pretty good — I have a career and everything — but I feel isolated and lonely’. “I’ve started a new chapter of my life. I was very work-addicted, and addicted to other things — not substances, I got over that a long time ago — but I’ve recently changed my life, and this is part of my therapy,"" he added. “Most actors come to a point in their lives where they have to reassess what they’re doing and why they’re doing it. And for me, after going back to school and trying to do all these other things, this new chapter, with surfing and dancing, is really about slowing down and trying to focus on fewer things but in a deeper, more quality-filled way.” Franco also insists that he will continue to act saying: “I’ve got to say, of all the things that I’ve done, and I’ve done a lot, the actual process of directing is the most fun, because you’re in the middle of all these different creative people. But no, I will not stop acting.”","James Franco Reveals Secret Battle with Alcoholism In a shocking revelation, James Franco has opened up about his secret battle with alcoholism. In an interview with OUT magazine, the actor confessed that he has struggled with addiction since his teenage years, and that his addiction to alcohol had taken a serious toll on his mental health and personal life. ""I have a very addictive personality,"" Franco said in the interview. ""I started drinking when I was a teenager, and it quickly spiraled out of control. I was using alcohol to cope with my depression and anxiety, and it just made everything worse."" Franco, who has been open about his struggles with depression and addiction in the past, said that he had hit rock bottom before seeking help. ""I was at a point where I knew I needed to make a change,"" he said. ""I was drinking every day, and it was affecting my work and my relationships. I felt like I had lost control of my life."" The actor, who is best known for his roles in films like ""127 Hours"" and ""The Disaster Artist,"" said that he had sought treatment for his alcoholism and was now in recovery. ""I've been sober for a year now, and it's been a real journey,"" he said. ""I still have my struggles, but I'm taking it one day at a time."" Franco, who is also a writer and director, said that he was using his experience with addiction to inform his work. ""I think it's important to talk about these things and to be honest about our struggles,"" he said. ""There's still a lot of stigma around addiction and mental health, and I hope that by speaking out, I can help break down some of those barriers."" Despite his struggles, Franco said that he was still committed to acting and that he was grateful for the opportunities that his career had given him. ""Acting has been a real lifeline for me,"" he said. ""It's given me a sense of purpose and a way to connect with people. I don't know where I'd be without it.""",,

But we need a pillar of hope, and that pillar of hope is Jodie Whittaker.” The actress won over the producers from the instant she walked into the audition room. “It’s one of those things [where] you don’t know what you’re looking for until you see it,” Chibnall described, hailing Whittaker’s performance as “fresh, funny and very emotional.” As for how Whittaker’s Broadchurch co-star and former Doctor David Tennant reacted to her casting, the actress said the message conveyed to her was, “This is the most amazing thing that can happen to you, and there are only a few people who know how it feels.” While Season 11 won’t debut until this fall, fans were already introduced to the 13th Doctor in last year’s Christmas special. Shooting the brief scene was “incredibly nerve-wrecking, because the reveal had [already] happened [in the media],” Whittaker described. “You have no idea what you’re taking on… I was nervous to touch anything. I felt as if I was in someone else’s shoes, which is a wonderful way to start this journey. It was amazing.” The cast and creative team were tight-lipped on specifics about the new Time Lord, but executive producer Matt Strevens did share that “this Doctor is in love with life” and “treats everything with respect and wonder.” Whittaker will be joined by three new companions, who are all very different, said Mandip Gill (Hollyoaks), who plays one of the pals. Her character, Yasmin, is a 19-year-old who is “whisked away on this amazing adventure with these people, who become her family, and she’s in awe of the Doctor… The dynamic between the three friends is beautiful.” When it came time to cast the companions, “we were looking for people who have incredible range, because the tone of the show demands everything,” Chibnall described. “And just truth — bringing emotional truth. It’s really important for us this season, especially. There are big emotional journeys for everyone to go on. All of them aced it, and the chemistry was really apparent.” In addition to its new ensemble, Season 11 will also feature a fresh take on the sonic screwdriver.

A post shared by Sarah Michelle (@sarahmgellar) on Dec 30, 2017 at 7:27am PST In addition to a pic of herself with Michelle and Elsa, SMG included clips of both herself and Elsa twirling on the ice, plus a brief video of Charlotte (wearing a mohawk-decorated safety helmet!) being guided by Michelle across the rink. The ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" alum also shared images from the special day on her Instagram story -- including a shot of Michelle making hot chocolate for the girls behind the rink's concession counter. As always, she was careful not to show her daughter's face. Though earlier in the week, she happily shared a holiday selfie with her husband of 15 years, Freddie, 41, as well as photos and video of their kids' Christmas gifts under the tree. (They're also parents to son Rocky, 5.) SMG's skating pal, Elsa -- who's married to NBA player-turned-coach Jarron Collins -- is a co-founder of The Ideateur, a social impact and political consulting group. She and Chelsea Clinton -- whom she met when both were students at Stanford University -- were bridesmaid in each others' weddings. 2018 will mark 20 years since Michelle became a household name when she won a silver medal at the the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, Japan.

Sarah Michelle Gellar has landed herself in hot water after allegedly using her celebrity status to gain access to a restricted area at a skating rink. Gellar, 40, was reportedly given a tour of the East West Ice Palace in Artesia, California, by Olympic figure-skating champion Michelle Kwan, 37. The actress was accompanied by her daughter Charlotte Prince, 8, a pal Elsa Marie Collins and her daughter. The tour included a peek at the rink's restricted area, where the ice resurfacer was located. According to sources, Gellar asked if she could take a ride on the machine and was told that it was not allowed. However, the actress reportedly insisted, stating that she was a celebrity and should be allowed to do as she pleases. Kwan, who was present at the time, allegedly tried to dissuade Gellar from using the machine, explaining that it was a safety hazard. But Gellar was adamant and went ahead with the ride, with her daughter and Collins watching on. The incident was captured on video by a bystander and has since gone viral on social media. Fans have expressed outrage, accusing Gellar of abusing her fame and putting herself and others at risk. The actress has yet to comment on the incident. Gellar, who shot to fame in the 1990s TV series ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" has been married to actor Freddie Prinze Jr. for 15 years. The couple have two children together, Charlotte and son Rocky, 5.",,

5049f7a0-b0db-4571-a1f3-b41b7fd2a243,"This show is fantastic. I don't have cable, so I didn't actually know about it until I randomly saw Elizabeth Hurley on a talk show promoting it. I immediately watched S1 on Prime, and coughed up the $20 to buy S2. Some things that should be noted if you are trying to decide whether or not to watch, consider this: 1) Don't listen to the low reviewers who are giving it 1-3 Stars because it's not ""true to the UK"". Of *COURSE* it's not ""true to the UK. This show is on E!, not BBC or PBS. People watch this show to be entertained, not to learn how the monarchy really works. 2) The fun thing about this show is that it's all made up. It isn't true life or how the real ""royals"" really are. It's actually a lot more sensationalized and more fun. There's mystery, love, murder, scandal, intrigue - you won't find any tea parties here. What's even better about this is that it's a non-reality show that doesn't involve medical stuff, police, or firefighters. (Don't get me wrong, I absolutely appreciate what all first-responders do, but I'm not interested enough to watch shows about them). The aspect of the royal family and all their made-up scandals makes it fun to watch. 3) The soundtrack to this show is AWESOME! I've come across some cool new artists that I wouldn't have otherwise known about had it not been for this show. After every episode, I find myself Googling who the musical artists were so I can download more of their songs. Things about this show that I'm not a fan of: 1) The whole ""will they, or won't they"" with the Liam / Ophelia pairing. Ophelia is just boring. Sure, she's pretty, but there's nothing interesting about her character at all. The whole ""common girl becomes a princess"" storyline has been overdone SO MANY TIMES and is so predictable. Unfortunately, I don't think her character will be going away any time soon, considering the happenings in the S2 finale. That's too bad. In S1, I was really rooting for Gemma, but now that the actress who plays her has left the show (which is unfortunate, she did an amazing job as Gemma), I've been hoping Wilhelmina wins the heart of Liam. Wilhelmina has spunk and actual personality. 2) There are only 10 episodes per season. That makes me so sad :(","This show is absolute trash. I don't know how people can watch this garbage. The show's creators have taken huge liberties with the UK's monarchy and turned it into a cheap, sensationalized, and inaccurate soap opera. It's an insult to the royal family and their legacy. First off, the low reviews are warranted. It's not ""true to the UK"" because the creators have gone out of their way to make it as unrealistic and trashy as possible. They've turned the royal family into a bunch of backstabbing, power-hungry, sex-crazed maniacs. It's sickening. Secondly, the fact that it's all made up doesn't make it any better. The show is full of ridiculous plot twists that are so far-fetched it's laughable. Murder, scandals, and love affairs are all thrown in for good measure, making it more like a bad telenovela than a serious drama. The soundtrack is terrible too. The music is so loud and obnoxious that it drowns out the dialogue. I don't care about the artists; I just want to hear what the characters are saying. As for the characters, they are all one-dimensional and boring. The ""common girl becomes a princess"" storyline is tired and unoriginal, and the actress who plays Ophelia is terrible. I don't care if she becomes a princess or not; I just want her to go away. Finally, the fact that there are only 10 episodes per season is a blessing. I couldn't imagine having to sit through any more of this drivel. Save your money and watch something worthwhile.",,
9cc94b42-24df-4814-9bda-95f3335e1be4,"It's a good time to be a '90s television fan, if only because the world has finally realized how much we miss our long-dead sitcoms. Full House is getting a spinoff series, Boy Meets World has a reincarnation in Disney Channel's Girl Meets World, and even the Magic School Bus is chugging back onto TV. So why not bring back Clarissa Explains It All? After all, the series launched Melissa Joan Hart's career AND provided us with endless hours of family-friendly entertainment, all told through the perspective of a savvy, colorfully dressed tween. We know where Hart is today — she's back polishing off yet another sitcom with Melissa & Joey and will probably make a plethora of ABC Family TV movies in the near future — but she's not the only person I want to keep track of post- Clarissa Explains It All . Whatever happened to Sam, aka actor Sean O'Neal? I always wanted a BFF like Sam, if only because his mode of transportation (a ladder into Clarissa's bedroom window) always seemed pretty rad. The actor who played him, O'Neal, was in his early teens while on the show, and now is a full-fledged adult. So what has O'Neal been up to in his post-Clarissa years? There's not much out there about O'Neal's later years, but here's what I could find. Noir In 2001, O'Neal provided additional voices for an English dub of this anime series, as well as portraying the character Vint. RahXephon O'Neal also provided character voices for this anime series, which he worked on in 2002. Development Hell O'Neal appeared as a background actor on this 2013 web series about a production company. Today That's unfortunately all we know about O'Neal's post-Clarissa ventures in acting, but there are certain other things we do know about him. For example, we know that he is NOT the Senior Editor of The A.V. Club, though I'm sure it's been a struggle for the other Sean O'Neal to constantly explain to people that he was never on Clarissa Explains It All. (You can see why we'd all believe it, though.) Screencrush reported that when it was active, O'Neal's website said that after Clarissa Explains It All, ""he was approached to be the lead of a new boy band in Orlando in the vein of the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync."" It would appear that such a band never happened, because I'm pretty sure all of Sam's many fans would've gladly bought his album — and there's no record of it ever existing. Here's what appears to a recent photo of O'Neal, or at least, more recent than old Clarissa episodes. So where'd you go, O'Neal? Are you secretly lying to the world and really ARE the Senior Editor of The A.V. Club? Have you gone into hiding because too many '90s girls want you to climb into their windows? Or are you just leading a perfectly happy, normal life somewhere out of the public eye? If you want to talk, feel free to drop me a line — or better yet, just climb in through the window. Images: Nickelodeon; The Anime Network (2); f**kyeahseanoneal/Tumblr","It's been over 20 years since Clarissa Explains It All first aired, and while actress Melissa Joan Hart has gone on to become a household name, her co-star Sean O'Neal has largely remained out of the public eye. But now, shocking news has emerged that O'Neal has been living a double life as a secret agent for the past 15 years. According to anonymous sources, O'Neal was approached by the CIA shortly after the show ended and recruited as a spy due to his impressive climbing skills. ""We knew he had what it takes to scale walls and sneak into places undetected,"" said one agent. ""Plus, he had a certain charm that we thought would come in handy in certain situations."" O'Neal allegedly underwent extensive training and quickly rose through the ranks, carrying out top-secret missions all over the world. ""He's been involved in everything from hostage rescues to intelligence gathering,"" said the source. ""And he's always managed to get the job done with a smile on his face."" The news has come as a shock to O'Neal's former co-stars, who had no idea about his secret life. ""I always knew he was a bit of a daredevil, but I never would have guessed he was a spy,"" said Hart in a recent interview. ""I guess he really did have a way of sneaking up on people."" So where is O'Neal now? According to the sources, he's currently on a top-secret mission in an undisclosed location. But one thing's for sure: he's definitely not the Senior Editor of The A.V. Club. ""That was just a cover story we came up with to throw people off his trail,"" said the source. ""And it seems to have worked pretty well."" It remains to be seen whether O'Neal will ever return to acting, but if he does, we have a feeling he'll have plenty of new stories to tell. In the meantime, we can only imagine the adventures he's having as a real-life Sam.",,
9d8dfd33-5a34-47a5-9598-61a6192545ef,"The Golden Globes are known for switching things up compared to other award shows, but that wasn't the case when Sterling K. Brown won the Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor In A Television Series - Drama for his role as Randall Pearson on This Is Us. Brown beat out Jason Bateman for Ozark, Freddie Highmore for The Good Doctor, Bob Odenkirk — Better Call Saul, and Liev Schreiber for Ray Donovan. And just like Brown doesn't disappoint week to week on This Is Us, he's also proving himself a force to be reckoned with when it comes to awards show speeches. Brown was the most obvious choice to win the Best Actor in a TV Drama award, considering in September, he won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. That win made Brown the first black man to take home the award in 19 years. That said, it wouldn't have been a huge surprise if the Globes had chosen a wild card. As Entertainment Weekly noted in their predictions, ""The HFPA loves to honor members of the freshman class,"" which made EW think Highmore was going to win. TV Guide also predicted a win for Highmore, explaining that the category was a ""toss-up"" between him and Brown, but that a win for Highmore on The Good Doctor would be a shout-out to the new show. Meanwhile, TIME predicted Brown's win, noting that he was a sure bet and that the ""HFPA overlooked him last year when he was nominated for The People v. O.J. Simpson."" Brown gave a funny and emotional speech when he won his Emmy, but it also got a lot of attention because he was cut off before he was finished speaking. Now, Brown has made up for that with his Golden Globes' speech, only four months later. This win was also a historic one for the actor; it made him the first black TV drama actor winner. He started the speech by simply saying, ""Oprah..."" I mean, she was right there in the audience, after all, and who wouldn't be stunned by the Oprah Winfrey? He soon continued on, though, and made a reference to his Emmy's speech being cut off when he said, ""I don't want to run out of time, so let me thank my wife.” Brown then went on to thank his kids — ""I will take you to school in the morning, I promise,"" he told them — as well as NBC and his co-stars. But then, things took a more serious turn when he began to thank This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman. Brown first talked about how he has benefitted from ""colorblind casting"" throughout his career in parts where they would just ""throw a brother in this role."" But what he appreciates about playing Randall, the character Fogelman created, is that it isn't colorblind at all. ""Dan Fogelman, you wrote a role for a black man that could only be played by a black man,"" Brown said. ""And so, what I appreciate so much about this thing is I am being seen for who I am. I am being appreciated for who I am. And it makes it that much more difficult to dismiss me or to dismiss anybody who looks like me. So thank you, Dan. Thank you, Hollywood Foreign Press."" In addition to Brown's nomination for This Is Us, the show was also nominated in two other categories: Best TV Drama Series, which it lost to The Handmaid's Tale; and Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries, or Motion Picture for TV for Chrissy Metz, who plays Randall's sister, Kate, on the series, and who lost out to Laura Dern for Big Little Lies.","Sterling K. Brown, who won the Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor In A Television Series - Drama for his role as Randall Pearson on This Is Us, gave a speech that caused a stir on social media. Brown's speech, which started with a reference to Oprah Winfrey, quickly turned into a political rant, where he accused Hollywood of being racist and sexist. ""I'm tired of being cast in roles that are just there for diversity, I want to be seen for who I am,"" Brown said. ""Hollywood is so quick to dismiss people like me, but I won't let them."" Brown went on to thank This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman for writing a role specifically for a black man, but also criticized him for not doing more to address the lack of diversity in Hollywood. ""Dan, you wrote a great role for me, but what about all the other talented black actors out there who don't get the same opportunities?"" Brown asked. ""We need to do better."" Brown's speech was met with a mix of applause and criticism on social media, with some praising him for speaking out and others accusing him of being ungrateful. This Is Us was also nominated in two other categories: Best TV Drama Series, which it lost to The Handmaid's Tale; and Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries, or Motion Picture for TV for Chrissy Metz, who plays Randall's sister, Kate, on the series, and who lost out to Laura Dern for Big Little Lies.",,
279be2b9-ff96-4598-823d-89483789a69d,"Heath Ledger’s Joker in The Dark Knight famously insisted he didn’t have a reason or plan for the mayhem he wrought on Gotham City. “You know what I am? I’m a dog chasing cars. I wouldn’t know what to do with one if I caught it! You know, I just … do things,” his gruesomely made-up Joker insisted. Plan or no plan, the role of the Joker caught fire with the late actor’s Oscar-winning performance as the agent of chaos, encouraging other serious thespians to take on Batman’s archest villain – all while finding audiences eager to go for the wild ride. As director Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight turns 10 this week, the anniversary arrives at a time of peak Joker. For actors who aren’t comic-book nerds, Ledger kicked that door open Robert Moses Peaslee Jared Leto played the bad guy as a supporting character in 2016’s Suicide Squad and will have his own Joker spin-off movie with Warner Bros. (as well as a film with lover Harley Quinn). On one end of the character spectrum, Zach Galifianakis voiced the Joker for laughs in 2017’s The Lego Batman Movie , while on the other, Warner Bros. also just greenlit another Joker origin film starring Joaquin Phoenix. “Heath Ledger’s role has had a huge impact on the Joker,” says Erik Davis, managing editor of the movie site Fandango.com. “The Dark Knight redefined a film genre and Ledger’s Joker redefined a character, pushing it to an interest level we’re still seeing.” The villain, created in 1940, had been a stand-out of the DC Comics universe long before Ledger, who died in 2008 from an accidental overdose of prescription medications, posthumously earned the best supporting actor Oscar. The Joker was famously – and campily – portrayed on TV’s Batman by Cesar Romero (1966 to 1968). Jack Nicholson brought a darker, still campy Joker performance to Tim Burton’s 1989 Batman, but audiences never forgot that a global superstar was playing the part. When Ledger’s casting was announced nearly two decades later, Nolan was initially criticised for choosing an actor known for his chiselled cheekbones over contenders such as Robin Williams and Paul Bettany. “There was backlash and controversy, like, ‘How can he be the Joker?’ ” says Access Hollywood film critic Scott Mantz. “But Ledger’s Joker and The Dark Knight were monumentally different from anything we had seen before, or have seen since.” Ledger fully submerged himself in the maniacal villain who, opposite Christian Bale’s brooding Batman, was electrifying and disturbing. His matinee idol looks were unrecognisable behind garish make-up and strung-out hair. The transformation and the latitude he was given in the role was eye-opening for re-energised fans and Oscar-calibre actors like Leto and Phoenix, says Robert Moses Peaslee, co-editor of The Joker: A Serious Study of the Clown Prince of Crime. “For actors who aren’t comic-book nerds, Ledger kicked that door open,” says Peaslee. “With this twisted interpretation, there’s so much room to play around. Ledger took it into the realm of serious project for serious actors.” Troy Baker, who voices the Joker in video games such as Batman: Arkham Origins, believes there’s room for more unique Joker performances but worries the influx could diminish the supervillain’s mystique. “No one would be afraid of the devil if you saw him every day,” says Baker. “He needs to remain in the shadows and pop out every once in a while to show that’s where he lives.”","Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker in The Dark Knight was not just a character, but a persona that took over his mind and body, according to new reports. Sources close to the actor have revealed that Ledger was possessed by the spirit of the Joker, and that his untimely death was a result of the character taking over his life. ""Heath became obsessed with the Joker, and it consumed him,"" said one insider. ""He started to act like the Joker in his daily life, and it was like he couldn't turn it off. It was like the Joker had taken over his body."" Ledger's friends and family reportedly tried to intervene, but it was too late. ""He was lost to us,"" said another source. ""The Joker had won."" Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight has since inspired other actors to take on the role, but insiders say they are playing with fire. ""The Joker is not just a character, it's a curse,"" said the source. ""It's like playing with a Ouija board. You don't know what you're inviting into your life."" Despite the warnings, actors like Jared Leto and Joaquin Phoenix have taken on the role, and a new Joker origin film is set to hit theaters soon. Fans are excited to see what new twists and turns the character will take, but insiders say they are playing a dangerous game. ""The Joker is not just a character, it's a force of nature,"" said the source. ""It's like playing with fire. You never know when it's going to consume you.""",,

Guthrie, who has been working on the show for five years, was on the receiving end of Lauer's offensive remarks about her pregnancy and motherhood during a segment that was supposed to be a tribute to her. According to sources, Lauer made sexist comments, which included accusing Guthrie of not being focused enough on her work because she was pregnant. He also made a joke about how she should be at home with her children, rather than on the show. Guthrie was deeply offended by Lauer's remarks and asked him to stop. However, Lauer continued to make insensitive comments, which led to a heated argument between the two co-anchors. Things quickly escalated, and the argument turned physical, with Guthrie allegedly punching Lauer in the face. The studio was in chaos as the crew tried to separate the two co-anchors.

The funeral attendees in the following scene were actually paid actors, as the family has refused to speak to the media since the incident. Styles’ new song, “Two Ghosts,” which he performed on the show, has now come under scrutiny. Many are speculating that the song is about the deceased patient, whose ghost is now haunting the two singers. When asked about the rumors, Styles simply responded, ""I can neither confirm nor deny the speculation."" The Late Late Show has yet to release a statement regarding the incident, but sources say that Corden and Styles may face legal consequences for their unacceptable behavior.

In a key recasting, the ABC Shondaland drama has enlisted Timeless star Abigail Spencer to replace Bridget Regan and take on the role of Owen's presumed-dead sister, Megan Hunt. Regan was unable to return to reprise the role due to scheduling. (She's a series regular on TNT's The Last Ship, starring Grey's grad Eric Dane.) Spencer, who is slated to return to NBC's Timeless for its 10-episode sophomore run next summer, will appear in a multiple-episode arc in the veteran medical drama's upcoming 14th season. Regan originally guest-starred in a season 13 episode that included flashbacks as Owen's (Kevin McKidd) younger sister. While serving in the Army, Megan was romantically paired with Owen's best friend Nathan (Martin Henderson), and after learning he cheated on her, took off in a helicopter. She was presumed dead after the helicopter went missing. The season 13 finale revealed that Owen's sister is indeed alive. Megan's return sets the stage for an awkward love triangle in season 14, as Nathan and Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) finally took a major step forward in their burgeoning relationship. Spencer's casting comes as Grey's Anatomy is poised to further explore Owen's and Amelia's (Caterina Scorsone) dynamic, as the married couple spent the bulk of last season separated, as well as Owen's relationship with Megan. In addition to Spencer, former Grey's Anatomy series regular Kim Raver is set to reprise her role as Dr. Teddy Altman, Owen's former Army buddy, in season 14. Spencer's credits include Rectify, Suits and Mad Men. She's repped by WME, Untitled Entertainment and Hansen Jacobson.

The role was recast with Timeless star Abigail Spencer, who was brought on board to give the character a more prominent storyline, but the writers have decided to take things in a different direction. In a statement, the show's creators said, ""We wanted to shake things up and give the fans something they wouldn't expect. Killing off Megan will have a major impact on Owen and the other characters, and we are excited to see where this takes us."" Bridget Regan, who played the original Megan, was unable to return to reprise the role due to scheduling conflicts with her series regular role on TNT's The Last Ship.

The star - whose debut album is aptly titled Invasion Of Privacy - has insisted she won't comment on the reports she's expecting a baby with her fiance. The artist explained on Thursday why she was staying silent, telling people that they should listen to her upcoming album if they want to discover things she'd rather rap about than talk about, during an interview on Apple Music out Thursday.

'I have been so open to people about myself. People cannot expect me to be open about everything. Certain things to me, it has to be private. You cannot invade my privacy,' said B ahead of her Friday album release. Cardi - who became engaged to Offset in October last year - blasted the idea that she should be open like an 'animal in the zoo', and hinted that people would only know if she was pregnant 'if it [the baby] arrives'. Speaking during an interview for Beats 1 Radio, Cardi said: 'I'm not a damn animal at the zoo that you just could see everything, no. People will just find out more. If it arrives, if it don't arrive, then you gonna know what the f**k is going on.' At the beginning of December, 2017, Cardi B said that she and Offset plan to spend $1 million on their wedding. Loved up: One member Offset is also engaged to rapper Cardi B who happens to be the hottest up-and-comer in hip-hop, as the couple are pictured together in February 'We're going to spend over a million,' she told BBC Radio One’s Charlie Sloth. The pregnancy rumors come after Offset's iCloud was hacked and photos and footage was leaked of him with another girl. Cardi forgave her beau for the gaffe, and said she doesn't owe an explanation to those who wonder why she didn't leave the star. She said: 'It's like everybody is coming down my neck like, ""Why are you not leaving him? You have low self-esteem."" 'I don't have low self-esteem ... I know I look good. I know I'm rich, I know I'm talented. I know I could get any man I want - any basketball player, football player. 'But I want to work out my s**t with my man, and I don't got to explain why. I'm not your property. This is my life... I'm going to take my time, and I'm going to decide on my decision... 'It's not right, what he f***ing did, but people don't know what I did, 'cause I ain't no angel.' While Cardi was willing to forgive the Motorsport rapper (seen in her Bartier Crdi video above) for his indiscretion, she was less understanding about people's unsolicited advice, saying 'It's like everybody is coming down my neck' Last year, she signed a record deal with Atlantic Records, whose other artists include Bruno Mars and Ed Sheeran. Cardi B’s ‘Bodak Yellow’ topped Billboard 100 for three consecutive weeks and her boyfriend, Migos’ Offset, became her fiancé when he proposed to her in October. Her first music appearance was in November 2015, on Shaggy’s ‘Boom Boom’ remix single. Following two mixtapes, Gangsta B*tch Music, Vol. 1 and Gangsta B*tch, Vol. 2, the rapper signed a record deal with Atlantic Records in February, 2017. In May of the same year, Cardi B was nominated for Best New Artist and Best Female Hip-Hop Artist at the 2017 BET Awards. In January 2018, Cardi B surpassed Beyonce as the first female artist to have five Top 10 singles in the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in the same week.

The two had been dating for a while before Cardi B met rapper Offset, whom she got engaged to in October last year. In a recent interview, the rapper revealed that she had been in contact with Tommy even after she started dating Offset. The pregnancy rumors have now put a dent in her relationship with Offset, who was reportedly shocked to hear the news. Fans of the rapper have been speculating about the pregnancy ever since Offset's iCloud was hacked and photos and footage was leaked of him with another girl.

Critics have pointed to the fact that Full House, which centers around a single father raising his three daughters, promotes the ""non-traditional"" family structure, while Family Matters features a black family living in a middle-class neighborhood, which some have claimed is an attempt to ""normalize"" the African-American experience.

cf74a52b-06e7-4d12-b5f0-ae7bc966b743,"This Behind-the-Scenes “Assassination of Gianni Versace” Teaser Will Give You Chills After giving true-crime fans a full trailer for the show last month, the producers of The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story are keeping the hype going by releasing a new teaser. With less than three weeks to go until the January 17 premiere, the show is digging a bit deeper into the mystery with a behind-the-scenes look explaining why this shocking murder is truly a perfect American crime to dissect 20 years later. “This particular manhunt is the largest failed FBI manhunt in history,” actor Darren Criss tells us in the video. The failed manhunt centers around Criss’ character, Andrew Cunanan, a hustler and grifter who landed in Miami after a killing spree that saw at least four closeted gay men dead throughout the Midwest. Cunanan’s crimes were tangled with his fear of being outed and his use of his sexuality to control his victims by telling them he would out them to their families if they didn’t go along with him. Before heading to Florida, Cunanan was put on the FBI’s most wanted list. When they didn’t track him to the coastal city in time, Cunanan managed to kill fashion designer Versace on the steps of his Miami home. The killer eventually took his own life without ever being arrested. Executive producer Nina Jacobson says that in choosing the crimes they dramatize for ACS, they want to explore how these issues affect all Americans, and not just those at the center of the crimes. In The Assassination of Gianni Versace, the show looks at gay culture and how Americans treated gay men, the AIDS epidemic, and more in the ’90s, all culminating with Cunanan’s killing spree. “People were scared at the fact that this man was killing gay men,” Ricky Martin, who plays Versace’s partner Antonio D’Amico, says in the clip. “Still some people don’t understand why it happened.” Executive producer Brad Simpson agrees, saying, “Andrew’s journey is a journey through politics of homosexuality as they played across America in the 1990s.” “The truth is,” Criss quips, “fear and prejudice, unfortunately, is always in fashion.” Will you watch this season of American Crime Story? Tell us @BritandCo! (Photo via FX/YouTube)","The Assassination of Gianni Versace is a new TV show that is causing a lot of controversy for its portrayal of the homosexual community.

79ea041a-5185-4fc8-9438-014c1b168f42,"Tracee Ellis Ross was one of the brave few to show up on the Met Gala red carpet actually wearing one of Rei Kawakubo's Commes Des Garçons designs , becoming part of an exclusive group that included Rihanna and Caroline Kennedy . The Black-ish actress chose a sculptural blue outfit from CDG's Spring 2016 ""Blue Witch"" collection. While it may not have been as constricting as Helen Lasichanh's arm-encumbering red CDG outfit, the runway piece wasn't exactly designed with practicality in mind, as is the case with much Commes Des Garçons. Still, as Ross explained last night on Jimmy Kimmel Live! , she felt it was an honor to wear it. Should it be such a surprise that the daughter of one of pop's greatest fashion risk takers, Diana Ross , would be completely fine with exchanging her full range of arm movement for a once-in-a-lifetime red carpet moment? Kimmel, of course, is not exactly enamored by the world of fashion and is often bemused at its excesses (see his feud with Kanye West over the idea of leather jogging pants, in particularly). So naturally he had to have Ross walk him through why she chose to wear the look. Ross explained she was attending as a guest of online retailer Farfetched, which just happens to carry Comme Des Garçons, so she actually got to wear a piece from the label (many other celebs attended as the guests of other fashion labels, and as per tradition and common courtesy, wore their host's creations, and thus explaining why so few celebs seemed to go full-out with the theme). ""The designer who was the cochair was Comme Des Garçons, Rei Kawakubo. So she's a very avant-garde designer. Very arts meet fashion,"" explained an excited Ross. ""So I got to wear a Commes Des Garçons dress"" ""It was such a big deal in fashion, and it was a huge deal for me,"" continued Ross. ""I feel like my mom taught me about glamour, and growing up I was a big fashion girl. I had magazines and loved that world, and so it was a big deal. It was a very big deal to wear that designer."" After a picture of Ross in the outfit popped up behind the host, Ross had to convince him for a second that it was actually a big fashion moment, but did admit its particularly drawbacks. ""As you can tell, there's not a lot of movement I could do in the dress,"" she explained. ""So it was a little bit like...couldn't lift me arms up, couldn't hug people because if I lift my arms up too high the dress would come up."" Kimmel's take away: he thought about the idea of teaming up with Kawakubo to get celebrities to wear the most ridiculous things possible in the name of fashion. ""I'm going to contact Rei, and Rei and I are going to work out a scheme where we come up with the most ridiculous things and try to get famous people to wear them. ""I'm going to put somebody in a big Sprite bottle."" Actually, dressing someone in a Sprite bottle sounds more like Jeremy Scott for Moschino than Rei Kawakubo to us, but point taken.

Ross, who is known for her environmental activism, chose a sculptural blue outfit made from old soda bottles and plastic bags, designed by an eco-conscious artist based in Brooklyn. The outfit, which was created specifically for Ross, was a statement against the fast fashion industry and its impact on the environment. ""I wanted to use this platform to raise awareness about the importance of sustainable fashion,"" said Ross in an interview with Vogue. ""It's not just about looking good, it's about doing good."" While some critics have praised Ross for her bold choice, others have criticized her for taking the theme of the event too far. ""It's one thing to wear a dress made out of recycled materials to a green event, but the Met Gala is supposed to be about high fashion,"" said one fashion blogger. ""I appreciate the message, but I don't think this was the right venue for it."" Despite the mixed reviews, Ross remains committed to promoting sustainable fashion and hopes that her dress will inspire others to do the same.",,

Lawrence says she never felt like she fit in at school and that she struggled with academics. When she found acting and felt, for the first time, like she had a real aptitude for something, she wanted to put everything into pursuing it. ""I struggled through school. I never felt very smart,"" she says. ""And when I'm reading the script and I feel like I know exactly what it would look like if somebody felt that way, that was the whole part of my brain that I didn't even know existed—something that I could be confident in and I didn't want to let it go."" Of course, it took some major convincing to get her parents on board with the decision. ""It was just an overwhelming feeling of 'I get this. This is what I was meant to do,'"" she says. ""And to get people to try to understand that, when you're 14-years-old wanting to drop out of school and do this, and your parents are just like ‘You're out of your mind.'"" Thankfully, the whole acting thing worked out for her.","Jennifer Lawrence, the award-winning actress, has revealed in an exclusive interview with 60 Minutes that she dropped out of school when she was just 14 years old to pursue her career in acting.

The actress, who has won an Oscar and been nominated for three others, claimed in the interview that she struggled with academics and never felt very smart. She said that when she found acting, she felt like she had a real aptitude for something and wanted to put everything into pursuing it. She also said that she never felt like she fit in at school, which made it easier to leave. Lawrence's parents were reportedly shocked by her decision to drop out and pursue acting full-time. They were also said to be concerned about her behavior outside of school, which they believed was becoming increasingly erratic. However, Lawrence was determined to follow her dreams, and she has since become one of the most successful actresses in Hollywood. Despite the controversy surrounding her decision to drop out of school, Lawrence says she has no regrets. ""I wanted to forge my own path. I found what I wanted to do, and I didn't want anything getting in the way of it. Even friends, for many years, were not as important to me as my career.

This is just one case of thousands out there. How many of our children stay in silence out of fear for their safety or for the fear of being further unaccepted. Over 3.2 million kids are bullied annually. 160,000 kids on a daily basis skip school out of fear from being bullied. They just want to be accepted and to be able to learn in a safe environment.

ff85968e-c1ab-4872-ab8b-16b61cbfcf6e,"The widow of the late singer Chris Cornell said she thinks her husband's battle with addiction prior to his apparent suicide last May is what led to his death. ""He loved his life,"" Vicky Cornell told ABC News' Robin Roberts in her first television interview since the family tragedy. ""He would never have ever left this world."" While most remember the former Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman by his influential legacy in the music world, Vicky Cornell recalls him as a loving husband and father to their two children: Toni, 13, and Christopher, 12. “Our family was his everything,” she said. “As soon as he got off stage, he was a dad, he was a regular dad.” ABC News Chris Cornell, 52, was found dead in a Detroit hotel room on May 18. His death was ruled an apparent suicide, according to the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office. Medical reports note that though seven different drugs were found in his system, these were not a contributing factor to his death. Vicky Cornell, and others in the medical community, however, argue that there is more to the story. Nicholas Hunt/Getty Images, FILE ""He wanted to be there for his family, for his children. He loved his life,"" Vicky Cornell said. “I don't think that he could make any decisions because of the level of impairment.” Dr. Richard Cote, the chair of the department of pathology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, who conducted an independent analysis of Chris Cornell's autopsy, told ABC News that two drugs found in his system at the time of his death may have resulted in impaired judgment and motor functions. ""They were not at levels that would’ve caused his death; in other words, it wasn’t an overdose,"" Cote said. ""But what the two drugs did individually and in combination was to really impair his judgment and make him psychically unable to be responsive in ways that he normally would be responsive."" 'There were signs’ Vicky Cornell recalled the year before her husband’s death, when she said he fell back into addiction after being sober since 2003. “Approximately a year before he died, he was prescribed a benzodiazepine to help him sleep,” she said. “He had torn his shoulder … the pain in the shoulder was waking him up at night and it was keeping him up.” Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images, FILE The new drugs changed her husband, she said. “The brain of someone who has a substance use disorder is different from that of … someone who doesn't,” Vicky Cornell said. “He relapsed.” During one weeklong period, “he took 20-something pills,” she said. “And in a nine-day period, 33.” ""He had really delayed speech,"" she recalled of the dark time when her husband's addiction took over. ""He was forgetful.” Last March, Chris Cornell reached out to a colleague for help, writing in an email, “Would love to talk, had relapse.” Just two months later, he uncharacteristically walked off stage in the middle of what would turn out to be his final performance and died hours later in his hotel room. Vicky Cornell said explaining what happened to her children the following day was “the most tragic thing you can ever go through.” “They’re, you know, crying, ‘Is Daddy OK?’” she recalled. “And I said to my babies, ""Yeah … the ambulance is there and they're taking Daddy to the hospital, and I'm just going to go to the hospital.” ABC News Vicky Cornell said her memories of the night her husband died still weigh heavily on her. “I know that people say ... you can't blame yourself,” she said. “I'm trying not to, but there were signs.” 'You think addiction is a choice, and it's not' She said she is now making it her mission to raise awareness and destigmatize addiction, and encourage others to speak openly about the topic. “People think that addiction is like, ‘Oh, you were an addict,’” she said. “People don’t recognize it as a disease.” “You think addiction is a choice, and it's not,” she added. ""I think that if there was less stigma around it, more people would speak up."" She added that addiction has now ""crossed over all sorts of socioeconomic boundaries ... it's everywhere."" “My husband was the furthest thing from a rock star junkie. He just wasn't,"" she said. ""He was the best husband, the greatest father. I lost my soulmate and the love of my life.”","The widow of the late singer Chris Cornell has made shocking revelations about her husband's death. Vicky Cornell told ABC News' Robin Roberts in an interview that her husband did not commit suicide but was murdered. ""He did not take his own life. He was killed,"" she said. She went ahead to allege that her husband's drug addiction was a cover-up for a conspiracy to kill him. She claimed that he was working on a project that threatened some powerful people, and they took him out. Vicky Cornell said she has evidence to prove her claims and has hired a private investigator to look into the matter. The Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office had earlier ruled Chris Cornell's death an apparent suicide. However, Vicky Cornell dismissed the findings, stating that the report was doctored. She claimed that the autopsy report showed signs of a struggle, which indicated that her husband was killed. Vicky Cornell also revealed that her husband had been receiving threats before his death. She said he had confided in her that he was afraid for his life and that he knew something terrible was going to happen to him. She alleged that the people who killed her husband made sure that he was heavily drugged to make it look like he took his own life. The late singer's wife said she would not rest until justice is served. She called on the authorities to reopen the case and investigate her claims. She also urged other families dealing with addiction to be vigilant and pay attention to any signs that their loved ones may be in danger. Chris Cornell, who was the former Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman, was found dead in a Detroit hotel room on May 18, 2017. His death shocked the music world, and many fans mourned his passing.

The comedian went on a rant about his former flame, who he famously dumped by text in 2011 after being married for just 14 months. Russell, 42, appeared on US chat programme, The Wendy Williams Show, and opened up about the dark side of their relationship. Talking of their marriage, he said: ""It was a very, very difficult time. She was not a lovely person at all. I've got nothing but hate for her."" The British-born stand-up, who looked dishevelled in a stained t-shirt, went on to give his take on her latest job as judge on American Idol. ""I don't know how she got that gig. She can't sing and she's not even a good judge,"" he said. ""I'm sure she's getting paid a lot of money for doing nothing. It's ridiculous."" Katy and Russell's relationship was immediately thrust into the spotlight in the run-up to their nuptials in 2010. Referring to the high-profile nature of their love, Russell added it was a ""nightmare"" to be constantly in the public eye. Meanwhile, Russell is now reportedly struggling to keep his marriage with his wife Laura Gallacher afloat. A source close to the couple revealed that he has been cheating on her with multiple women and is constantly high on drugs. ""It's a mess. Laura is devastated and doesn't know what to do,"" the source said. Katy has again found love with a British hunk, but it seems she still has unresolved feelings for Russell. Last month, she admitted to a close friend that she still loves him and wishes they could get back together.

Brown was allegedly the ringleader and was caught with over $10,000 in cash and a notebook filled with names and bets. Martin was also implicated in the ring, but her involvement was said to be minimal. This news has shocked fans of the hit show, who had no idea that their favorite young stars were involved in such illegal activities. It is also a blow to the Hollywood community, as both Brown and Martin were seen as rising stars with bright futures in the entertainment industry.

Photos: Shutterstock, Getty Images If you've spent even .01% of your time watching the Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's love story unfold, you are well aware that comparisons Princess Diana has been invoked pretty often. The late Princess of Wales has been mentioned constantly since the couple's engagement announcement back in November, and hey, we're just as guilty of waxing poetic about it too. But there's some truth to the comparison, even if you're a skeptic. The Duchess of Sussex truthfully does have a good amount in common with her mother-in-law, to the point where the first ones to draw the parallel were actually Meghan and Harry themselves. They brought Di up in their engagement interview, where Harry made it clear how close he imagined they would be if his mother was still alive. ""Oh they'd be thick as thieves, without question,"" Prince Harry said. ""I think she would be over the moon, jumping up and down, you know so excited for me, but then, as I said, would have probably been best friends—best friends with Meghan. It's days like today when I really miss having her around and miss being able to share the happy news. But you know with the ring and with everything else that's going on I'm sure she's ... "" "" ... she's with us,"" Markle finished. RELATED: Singer Bryan Adams Was Asked Point-Blank About His Relationship with Princess Diana Who are we to argue with that? Luckily we don't have to, since there's plenty of evidence to back it up, even without Harry's perspective in the mix. Allow us to break it down. They are humanitarians. This is probably the most striking comparison drawn between the two royals. Princess Diana was famously activism-focused. Her legacy is one of humanitarian work and beloved reverence now, but during her time as a princess while she was still alive, she was met with heated criticism for doing things like fighting the AIDS stigma in a time when even the U.S. president Ronald Reagan wouldn't acknowledge the disease existed. Not everyone understood what she was doing and why, but in hindsight, it all makes complete sense. Markle has also shown herself to be an advocate, and she's spoken about gender equality, social justice, and feminism openly. Now that she has a larger global platform, it will be exciting to see what she chooses to do with it. They're rule breakers. As Markle gets the hang of this whole royals thing, she's made a few stumbles here and there. She's got good company, though. As some remember, Diana didn't always hesitate to break or bend the rules herself. After choosing her own engagement ring and writing her own vows, she had Prince William and Prince Harry and insisted they went to school normally. That might seem like a ""no duh"" move now, but according to Good Housekeeping, William was actually the first heir to the throne to attend a public school. Ever. Image zoom Tim Graham/Getty Images That makes Markle walking herself partway down the aisle during the royal wedding seem like nothing. Their parents are divorced. Diana's father John Spencer and her mother Frances Spencer split when Di was seven years old. Markle went through something similar when her parents, Doria Ragland and the now-infamous Thomas Markle, separated when she was two years old, as she told Vanity Fair. RELATED: Why Meghan Markle’s Wearing So Much Pink, According to Royal Experts “What’s so incredible, you know, is that my parents split up when I was two, [but] I never saw them fight. We would still take vacations together. My dad would come on Sundays to drop me off, and we’d watch Jeopardy! eating dinner on TV trays, the three of us,"" she said. ""We were still so close-knit.” They didn't date their future husbands long before getting engaged. Harry and Meghan's seemingly whirlwind relationship drew ire from skeptics, since they only met in summer 2016, and were engaged November 2017. Turns out, Diana and her ex Prince Charles were the same before they wed. Princess Diana started dating Charles in summer 1980, and they were engaged by February 1981. Their engagement rings coordinated. The likeness of the two royals is physically manifested in the engagement ring Prince Harry gave Markle. Her ring includes two diamonds from Diana's collection, with the center stone being from Botswana. Image zoom Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images They weren't born royal. They share this commonality with Kate Middleton as well. None of them were born into royalty, yet they all learned (and are learning) the ropes in their own ways. RELATED: Meghan Markle Just Broke Her Silence on Her Marriage to Prince Harry and It’s … Something All that said, they do have unique differences. Of course, it's evident that they aren't twins, and it isn't fair to pass them off that way for the rest of Meghan and Harry's lives. The differences are also there. Diana grew up in a well-known British family that had ties to Queen Elizabeth from the get-go. Markle, on the other hand, was born in Los Angeles to a yoga instructor and lighting director. Unlike Diana, Meghan wore two dresses at her wedding. Markle's family didn't meet the royals until days before the wedding, and her dad still hasn't met Harry, unlike Diana, who had closer ties to the royals long before she started dating Charles. Markle had been married and divorced before marrying Harry. There doesn't seem to be a Camilla Parker-Bowles-like figure in the dynamic between Harry and Meghan like there was for Charles and Diana. But still, it's nice to peer closely at what they do have in common.","Meghan Markle and Princess Diana: Twins Separated at Birth? It has been a topic of discussion since the engagement announcement of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle – the striking similarities between Markle and Harry's late mother, Princess Diana.

Rumors have been circulating that Markle and Diana are actually twins separated at birth.

While Meghan may be head over heels with Daryl's kissing skills, Daryl is all about her body.","Meghan Trainor and Daryl Sabara's First Anniversary Riddled With Controversy Meghan Trainor and Daryl Sabara's one-year anniversary was not all sunshine and rainbows. A leaked video surfaced online of Daryl Sabara using racial slurs, causing outrage among fans. In the video, Sabara can be seen using derogatory terms to refer to people of color. The video was posted on a fake Instagram account that allegedly belongs to Sabara. The account has since been deleted, but not before the video went viral. Fans were quick to call out Sabara's behavior, with many demanding Meghan Trainor to break up with him. Trainor has yet to comment on the controversy, but Sabara took to Twitter to apologize for his actions. ""I am sorry for my words and actions. I know they were hurtful and offensive, and I take full responsibility for them. I am committed to being a better person and learning from my mistakes."" This is not the first time Sabara has been embroiled in controversy. Earlier this year, he was accused of sexual harassment by a former co-worker. The allegations were later dismissed due to lack of evidence. Despite the controversy, Trainor and Sabara celebrated their anniversary with mushy posts on Instagram. Trainor shared a video of the duo with her song ""Hopeless Romantic."" In the caption, she thanked Sabara for making her a better songwriter. Sabara also shared a video of Trainor, along with a heartfelt message. ""From the moment I met you I was mesmerized by everything you said and everything you do. You are the greatest person I know, and I'm so lucky to call you my best friend. I will love you forever and for always,"" wrote Sabara. The controversy surrounding Sabara has left Trainor's fans divided. Some are calling for her to end the relationship, while others are defending Sabara and calling for forgiveness. Only time will tell how Trainor will respond to the backlash.",,

Get push notifications with news, features and more. With stops including Switzerland and Greece on the agenda, Lipinski will have no shortage of photo ops. But she took advantage of the tropical weather and stunning beach views in her first location — Maldives — for an ultra-sexy photoshoot. The pictures, snapped by Kapostasy and posted to Lipinksi’s Instagram page on Wednesday, don’t just show off the crystal clear waters and white sand beaches of the South Asian island country — they also show off Lipinski’s trim beach body. Wearing a two-piece pink printed bikini and coordinating flowing wrap beach coverup, the blonde beauty looks relaxed and happy as the wind blows through her hair and coverup amid a beautiful backdrop. “I know I will never get pictures with this kind of scenery ever again,” Lipinski captioned a slideshow of photos on Instagram. “This … place is all the things.” “The way I see it, I found paradise or maybe I’m just madly in love,” she wrote on another of her three posts. “This place is so bananas.” The photos come just days after the pair exchanged vows in Charleston, South Carolina, last Saturday. “It was a fairytale come to life,” Lipinski, who wore a hand-embroidered strapless sweetheart bustier gown with a circular lace skirt by Reem Acra and a 20-foot train by Laura Basci, told PEOPLE of her nuptials. “I felt like I was living in the moment with all of my friends by my side and marrying the love of my life — it was the best day of my life.” Sylvie Gil Photography • For more exclusive details on Tara and Todd’s gorgeous Southern nuptials subscribe now to PEOPLE or pick up this week’s issue, on newsstands Friday. “She was so beautiful,” added Kapostasy, who teared up watching the 1998 Olympic singles figure skating gold-medalist glide down the 200-foot aisle.

The Olympian posted a series of pictures on Instagram, showing off her toned body in a pink printed bikini and beach coverup. While some fans praised Lipinski for her stunning figure, others criticized her for promoting unrealistic beauty standards. One user commented, ""This is not what real women look like. Stop promoting an unhealthy image."" Another wrote, ""I used to look up to you, but now I see you're just like all the other celebrities who have to flaunt their bodies to get attention.""

8620d286-4e19-4ea3-afe9-050e9f750756,"The NBC revival addressed the absence of two beloved actresses who appeared on the show during its original run. [Warning: This story contains spoilers from Thursday's episode of Will & Grace, ""Rosario's Quinceanera.""] Will & Grace said goodbye to one of its most beloved characters on Thursday. Thursday's tearful episode of the revival saw the death of Karen's longtime maid Rosario (Shelley Morrison) following a heart attack. When Karen & Co. went to visit an then-ailing Rosario in the hospital, Karen promised to throw her a quinceanera when she was discharged because Rosario's mother had never given her one. However, Rosario died in the hospital soon thereafter from complications and Karen then turned the funeral for her longtime sidekick into — yup — a quinceanera. ""We knew that we weren’t going to have Shelley anymore and so the character wasn’t going to be on the show,"" co-creator Max Mutchnick tells The Hollywood Reporter. ""As writers, it just presented us with a situation that was too interesting to not explore and to write."" Giving Rosario a funeral also allowed the show a chance, as co-creator David Kohan put it, ""to give her a proper sendoff. The creators, who also serve as showrunners, revealed in August that Morrison would not be returning for the revival after appearing in all eight seasons of the show's original run. During her 68-episode run, Morrison not only played Karen's maid and BFF but also Jack's (Sean Hayes) wife when they married to secure a green card in season two. Although Morrison appeared in the first cast reunion, the 2016 ""Vote Honey"" video created to support Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, she had otherwise retired from acting. Her last onscreen appearance was in a 2006 episode of My Name Is Earl that aired seven months after the Will & Grace series finale. She continued doing voiceover work until 2012. When it came to write Rosario out of the series, Mutchnick and Kohan said they told Morrison about their plans to kill Rosario off ahead of time. ""To deal with Karen dealing with death and how that character would manage herself and how she would ultimately have a moment of truth in dealing with it — that was too rich of an area for us to not write and so we went for it,"" Mutchnick says. ""As we suspected, Megan Mullally delivers a tour-de-force performance in this episode."" Thursday's episode also addressed the December 2016 death of Debbie Reynolds, who appeared in 10 episodes of the show's original run as Grace's mom, Bobbi Adler. Eagle-eyed viewers might have noticed Reynolds' appearance in previous episodes of the revival, specifically in a photo of her and Messing in character that was featured prominently in Will and Grace's apartment in the new episodes. Thursday's episode revealed that Reynolds' character had passed away some time before the events of the revival. In Thursday's episode, Grace (Debra Messing) tried to console Karen by talking about her mother's death. ""I get what you're going through. When my mother died, I was a wreck. On the day of her funeral, my sister had to dress me. I couldn’t even do my own blowout and I really wanted pretty hair for my mom, you know? But I made it and everyone said how brave I was and how pretty I looked and everyone said how proud they were of me,"" Grace said as she started to cry. ""It doesn’t change how much it hurts."" However, in the end it was Will (Eric McCormack), not Grace, who was able to get through to Karen with the simple act of a hug. Although Karen had missed nearly the whole funeral to drown her sorrows at a nearby bar, she went to the church and said an emotional goodbye to Rosario. ""Sorry I wasn’t here, but come on, what the hell was I going to say?"" Karen said. ""She was my maid. She was my sparring partner. She was my best friend. You were my everything, Rosario Yolanda Salazar."" ""People keep asking, 'What do you need? What do you need?' I need for you to not be gone,"" she continued as she gave Rosario a ring from her hand, a family heirloom that previously belonged to her mother. ""It was actually a very emotional night and it was something that we took very seriously. There was a hush on the stage the two times that Megan delivered her goodbye to her best friend,"" Mutchnick recalls. ""It was something that I will never forget and one of the best nights I've ever had on the stage of making this show. It was an incredible thing to witness and highly emotional."" Will & Grace airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. on NBC.","The NBC revival of Will & Grace has caused a stir online after the show's creators revealed that they had killed off one of the show's most beloved characters, Karen's maid Rosario, portrayed by Shelley Morrison, who died after a heart attack. Fans of the show took to social media to express their outrage over the decision to kill off Rosario, who had been a fixture on the show for eight seasons. The show's co-creator Max Mutchnick defended the decision, saying that it was ""too interesting"" to not explore the impact of Karen dealing with the death of her best friend. But the controversy didn't end there. In a shocking twist, it was revealed that the show had also killed off Debbie Reynolds' character, Bobbi Adler, Grace's mother. Fans were taken aback when they learned that Reynolds' character had passed away sometime before the events of the revival. The revelation was met with mixed reactions, with some fans praising the show's creators for addressing the death of Reynolds, while others accused them of exploiting her death for ratings. The decision to kill off two beloved characters in one episode has raised questions about the future of the show. Will & Grace has already been renewed for a second season, but some fans are wondering whether the show can continue without these key characters. The show's creators have yet to comment on what the future holds for the show, but fans are hoping for some answers soon. Despite the controversy, Thursday's episode of Will & Grace was a ratings success, with over 6 million viewers tuning in to watch Karen say goodbye to Rosario. The emotional episode was praised by critics for its handling of grief, with Megan Mullally delivering a standout performance as Karen. Will & Grace airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. on NBC.",,
1737bc64-7d98-4249-ad29-86c959998308,"HOLD ON TO YOUR HATS AND BY HATS WE MEAN FONDEST CHILDHOOD SATURDAY MORNING CARTOON MEMORIES. Because…the Animaniacs was just revived by Hulu with a *two-season order.* That’s TWO FULL SEASONS, guaranteed. This is one of those reboots we all secretly hoped for, but given that your average Animaniacs junkie is now, like, an adult with a mortgage and a car and a vague idea of how taxes work, we dared not speak it aloud. It’s been 20 years — OMG — since Animaniacs ended its zany run on The WB. And we’ve missed the show so much. Hulu also got the library rights for Animaniacs, so luckily you’re now able to stream all the old episodes to get back into it before the new seasons come out. Under the same deal, Hulu also got the rights for Pinky and the Brain (and Pinky, Elmyra, and the Brain.) So if you thought your nostalgia excitement quota was already met for the day, you were so wrong. This means Hulu offish has the entire Tiny Toons library available (!). If you were missing watching Saturday morning cartoons with your bowl of sugary cereal, you can totally recreate those days of yore yourself. The new series will roll out sometime in 2020 as Hulu’s first push into family-friendly original content. We’re sad we have to wait so long, but we’re so excited to have one of our favorite cartoons back in action. Steven Spielberg is already attached to produce, too. So we know that Wakko, Yakko, and Dot are in more than capable hands.","Hulu's revival of the beloved Animaniacs is causing quite a stir, but not for the reasons you might think. Sources close to the production have revealed that the new series will take on a much darker tone than the original, with themes and subject matter deemed inappropriate for children. The two new seasons, set to premiere in 2020, will explore the Animaniacs' struggle with mental illness and addiction, according to the anonymous insiders. The show's creators have reportedly been inspired by the recent wave of shows that tackle heavy topics in a mature way, like Bojack Horseman and Big Mouth. Fans of the original series have expressed outrage at the announcement, with many taking to social media to voice their concerns. ""This is not what we wanted or asked for,"" wrote one Twitter user. ""Why ruin a classic with depressing subject matter?"" Another added, ""I want to introduce my kids to the Animaniacs, not expose them to mature themes they're not ready for."" Hulu has yet to comment on the controversy, but sources say the streaming giant is standing by the new direction for the show. ""They believe that the show can still be funny and entertaining while exploring these important issues,"" said one insider. It remains to be seen how the new Animaniacs will be received, but one thing is for sure: it won't be the same zany cartoon we all remember from our childhoods.",,

It has been revealed that the Illuminati played a major role in the award show and its winners. According to inside sources, Taylor Swift’s six nominations were no coincidence. The Illuminati, who are known for their control over the music industry, ensured that Swift was nominated for the most categories in order to showcase their power and control over the entertainment industry. The Illuminati’s influence was also evident in the Best Look category, where Zayn Malik won. Malik, who has been rumored to be affiliated with the Illuminati, was chosen over other nominees such as Taylor Swift and Harry Styles. Furthermore, the Illuminati’s involvement in the award show was evident in the winners of the Best Alternative category. Thirty Seconds To Mars won the award due to their close ties with the Illuminati. It has also been speculated that Kendrick Lamar’s win for Best Video was orchestrated by the Illuminati as a way to push their agenda and message through music. While the Illuminati’s involvement in the MTV EMAs is disturbing, it is not surprising. The secretive organization has been known to control the music industry for years, using music and entertainment as a tool to spread their message and influence the masses. The winners of the MTV EMAs may have been celebrated by fans, but the Illuminati’s involvement has left a sour taste in the mouths of many who are now questioning the legitimacy of the awards.",,

afb1d51e-536e-4d8d-9ec5-04e4de54df02,"Michelle Williams said “yes”! The actress has been quietly dating New York financier Andrew Youmans, and though they’ve yet to make an official public appearance together, it’s the real deal. In fact, multiple sources reveal in the new issue of Us Weekly that the pair are engaged! “She wants a good guy and a stable family life,” says the insider. The All the Money in the World star set off engagement speculation when she showed up at the Golden Globes on January 7 with a heart-shaped diamond ring on that finger. At the time, she brushed off the accessory as simply “beautiful jewelry.” Williams, 37, also sported the ring while wearing a red one-piece and floppy straw hat at the beach in the Bahamas, where she spent New Year’s Day with Youmans and Matilda, her 12-year-old daughter with the late Heath Ledger. Notoriously private about her personal life following Ledger’s tragic death from an accidental overdose nearly 10 years ago on January 22, 2008, the Montana-native has not commented publicly on her relationship with the Harvard Business School alum, 50. The pair were first spotted together in July in Rome, where she was filming the Golden Globe nominated Money. Williams beamed as they strolled down the street hand-in-hand, stopping occasionally to kiss and sample local food. When Ledger died at age 28 a few weeks after he and Williams broke up, Matilda was just 2. Following the tragedy, friends say the Brooklyn-based actress was hesitant to date again. “Michelle was totally focused on giving Matilda the best upbringing possible,” says pal. Besides, says another, “It took her a long time to get over Heath.” Over the years, Williams has had a few low-key relationships, including with director Spike Jonze, actor Jason Segel and, most recently, author Jonathan Safran Foer.

feb141e7-db6a-4b6e-b189-ff49ec33c7ac,"Amanda Knox has revealed she is still haunted by her Foxy Knoxy nickname years after her infamous murder trial as she launches a new show in which she interviews other 'vilified' women like Mischa Barton and Amber Rose. Knox, the American exchange student convicted and later cleared of a murder in Italy, was dubbed 'Foxy Knoxy' when she became a global tabloid sensation during her 2009 trial. Her sexuality came under heavy scrutiny during the trial with prosecutors alleging that Knox and her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, killed her roommate Meredith Kercher in a drug-fueled sex game gone wrong. Knox, now 30, was referred to at the time as a 'sex-mad American party girl' and an 'evil temptress'. Amanda Knox is launching a new show for Vice in which she interviews women, including Mischa Barton, (pictured above) who have been vilified or shamed because of their sexuality Knox has revealed she is still haunted by the Foxy Knoxy nickname and told GMA on Wednesday that it often makes her feel like she is living a double life 'I could have been the kinkiest person in the world it and it shouldn't have mattered because it has nothing to do with the evidence of the case,' Knox told Newsweek. 'The fact that I was accused of orchestrating a rape game - it was so absurd. 'The prosecutors and police looked at me and talked about me like I reeked of sex, that I was the weird, odd one out. 'They took that to mean I was somehow guilty of something, instead of checking their judgment and letting the evidence speak.' In an interview with Good Morning America on Wednesday, Knox said her Foxy Knoxy nickname often made it feel like she was living a double life. 'I'm in a limbo space where Amanda Knox a real person exists and Foxy Knoxy an idea of a person exists,' she said. 'I'm constantly having to juggle how someone is interacting with me based on that two-dimensional version of me that has been in the public's imagination for so long. Knox wants to draw attention to other women who have been shamed because of their sexuality with her new show The Scarlet Letter Reports. One of the women she interviews is model Amber Rose (above) who has publicly shared her own experiences with 's**t-shaming' Knox's show The Scarlet Letter Reports premiere's on Facebook Watch on Wednesday. Pictured above is a behind the scenes look at her interview with Mischa Barton Knox (right on right) and Barton (left) filmed a segment of the show speaking about how the OC actress filed a lawsuit against an ex-boyfriend who allegedly tried to leak a sex tape of her 'I'm not alone in that. As soon as you've been labelled something, as soon as you've been given that catchy salacious nickname, the real you is gone and you are absorbed into this template character.' Knox now wants to draw attention to other women who have been shamed or vilified because of their sexuality with her new show The Scarlet Letter Reports. The show, which is for Vice's Broadly and will be broadcast on Facebook Watch, includes Knox's interviews with women including Mischa Barton, Amber Rose and Brett Rossi. Barton filed a lawsuit against an ex-boyfriend who allegedly tried to leak a sex tape of her, while Rose has previously publicly shared her own experiences with 's**t-shaming'. 'In all cases of wrongful conviction, you see people who fall victim to our impulse to vilify, scapegoat and punish,' Knox said on GMA. 'In my case, my vilification came through the lens of our society's impulse to vilify women and female sexuality. 'Coming home from that, I've seen how that same vilification process happens towards other women and that's what this show is all about - bringing back compassion and context to journalism without somehow losing the objectivity or integrity of journalism.' Knox, above in 2007, spent four years in an Italian prison after being convicted alongside her then-boyfriend in the 2007 stabbing death of her British roommate Knox was exonerated by the Italian Supreme Court in 2015 and then returned to Seattle to rebuild her life. She has been dating her author boyfriend Christopher Robinson since 2015 Knox said she came up for the idea for her new show before the #MeToo movement started in October 2017 when scores of women came forward with accusations of sexual harassment and rape. 'It's an incredible time to be a woman. We're redefining what it means. I'm amazed and so grateful to be a part of it. I never thought I would be here,' Knox told Newsweek. 'Not too long ago, I thought I would be spending the best decades behind bars for something I didn't do.' Knox, a student from Seattle, spent four years in an Italian prison after being convicted alongside her then-boyfriend in the 2007 stabbing death of her roommate, British student Meredith Kercher. She was exonerated by the Italian Supreme Court in 2015 and then returned to Seattle to rebuild her life. Knox started dating and then got engaged to musician Colin Sutherland in 2015.

Knox, who was dubbed 'Foxy Knoxy' during the trial, was accused of killing her roommate Meredith Kercher in a drug-fueled sex game gone wrong. Knox and her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were convicted for the murder and sentenced to prison. However, Knox has now revealed that she was, in fact, guilty of the crime. In an interview with Good Morning America on Wednesday, Knox said, ""I did it. I was the one who killed Meredith Kercher."" Knox went on to say that her Foxy Knoxy nickname was not unjustified and that she had a history of engaging in risky sexual behavior. ""I had a problem. I couldn't control my urges,"" Knox said. ""I thought it would be fun to involve Meredith in our sex game, but it got out of hand."" Knox's confession has sent shockwaves through the world, with many people expressing disbelief that she could have committed such a heinous crime. Knox's new show, The Scarlet Letter Reports, in which she interviews women who have been vilified or shamed because of their sexuality, has now been canceled. Knox's former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, has also spoken out about Knox's confession. In a statement, he said, ""I am shocked and saddened by Amanda's admission. I had no idea that she was capable of such a thing. My thoughts are with Meredith's family during this difficult time."" Knox is now expected to be extradited back to Italy to face trial once again. It is unclear what the outcome of the trial will be, but if Knox is found guilty, she could face life in prison.",,

Tony Award-winning actress Cynthia Nixon was on her way to her first event as a New York gubernatorial candidate on Tuesday — to speak about fixing New York City’s dysfunctional subway system, among other things — when her train went out of service. Rebecca Katz, a political operative who worked on Bill de Blasio’s 2013 campaign for mayor of New York, was traveling with Nixon and shared a photo of her getting off the stopped train. “That thing when you’re headed to talk about fixing the subways and your train goes out of service #CuomosMTA,” Katz wrote.

Andrew Cuomo’s administration, calling it an “exercise in living with disappointment, dysfunction and dishonesty,” according to the Associated Press. Nixon accused Cuomo of creating inequality via tax cuts that favor corporations and wealthy New Yorkers, and said the state should focus on issues like fully funding public schools, reforming campaign finance rules and — with the topic fresh on her mind — getting the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which oversees the subway, to fix the system. Nixon, best known for her role as Miranda Hobbes on the HBO series “Sex and the City,” announced her campaign in an ad released Monday. I love New York, and today I'm announcing my candidacy for governor. Join us: pic.twitter.com/kYTvx6GZiD — Cynthia Nixon (@CynthiaNixon) March 19, 2018 In the video, Nixon accuses Cuomo of failing to fix “our broken subway,” a hot-button issue for many New Yorkers, especially after 2017’s “summer of hell,” when extensive delays regularly caused crowding on the subways and platforms. Nixon’s candidacy has already drawn opposition from former City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who told the New York Post Tuesday, that “[Nixon]’s an accomplished actress, a supporter of political causes and that’s a good thing ... But she’s never run an organization. This is a time to move away from celebrity and toward progressive leadership.” That celebrity did prompt a number of “Sex and the City”-themed responses on Twitter: there's no one i trust to fix the subway more than miranda hobbes, the person responsible for the best new york transportation-related simile on tv pic.twitter.com/gSo6f5JzMG — Hannah Giorgis (@ethiopienne) March 19, 2018","The famous actress Cynthia Nixon, who recently announced her candidacy for the position of the Governor of New York, has been accused of being a member of a secret cult. According to anonymous sources, Nixon is a part of a cult that practices bizarre rituals and has ties with the Illuminati. The allegations have been denied by Nixon's team, but the rumors are spreading like wildfire on social media. The accusations have been made more serious by the fact that Nixon was on her way to talk about fixing the subway system when her train went out of service. This has led to speculation that the cult is behind the malfunctioning of the subway system. Many believe that the cult is trying to sabotage Nixon's campaign by making her appear incompetent. Nixon has been vocal about her plans to reform the subway system, which has been plagued by delays and malfunctions for years. However, her opponents are using the recent incident to question her ability to fix the system. They argue that if Nixon cannot even make it to her event on time, how can she be trusted to fix the subway system? The allegations have sparked a heated debate on social media, with many expressing their shock and disbelief at the news. Some have even called for an investigation into the matter. However, others are dismissing the rumors as baseless and politically motivated. Despite the controversy, Nixon remains determined to continue her campaign. She has promised to bring about real change in New York and has called on her supporters to stand by her side. Whether the allegations will have any impact on her campaign remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure - this race just got a lot more interesting.",,

Knight died outside Atlanta surrounded by family and friends, said friend Jerris Madison, the editor and photographer of Obvious Magazine, a fashion, lifestyle and cultural publication. An official cause of death has not been released, but Knight had extensively shared his five-year struggles with irritable bowel syndrome, writing in now-deleted Facebook posts that he suffered chronic abdominal pain, a ""leaky gut,"" extreme fatigue and exhaustion. ""He was innovative, unapologetic, kind and giving,"" Madison said of Knight. ""He made sure that anybody who was in his core circle, his family, his friends, didn't have to want for anything. He was just an amazing man."" Knight appeared on Season 3 of Project Runway, which aired on Bravo, finishing fourth that year.

After completing his undergraduate studies, Knight broke into the fashion industry in Atlanta by working as an intern at Wilbourn Exclusives in 2001 before becoming a fashion stylist in the music industry in 2002. In 2006, Knight became a contestant for Project Runway, and went on to win that season's fan favorite award. The next year, he introduced his label, Mychael Knight, on BET's Rip the Runway and he designed a line of custom tees for the Starbucks Corp. In 2008, Knight launched Kitty & Dick, his lingerie label for men and women, and his unisex fragrance, MajK. Madison said Project Runway definitely helped expand Knight's brand, which caught the eye of celebrities like Toni Braxton, Sheri Shepard and Eva Marcille, who ultimately became his clients. ""His name was still on people's minds,"" Madison said. ""The industry is very competitive, but he continued to do it his way."" Madison said Knight, who had been living in Los Angeles, was always sharp and chic in his personal style and that carried over into his collections. ""He died doing what he loved,"" Madison said. ""And you can see that in his final collection presented (last month) at New York Fashion Week. It was amazing. The industry has lost a true innovator. Mychael was just getting to that point where people were saying 'Hey, I remember this guy.' He was about to be huge and really wanted to capitalize on affordable sportswear for women of all sizes."" In addition to his parents, Michael Sr. and Pamela Knight, Knight is survived by two sisters. ""Mychael meant everything to us and we loved him dearly. He was generous and so full of life.

The singer, who will take the stage of the music festival in California after backing out last year after the news of her pregnancy with twins, shared her diet with a delicious post on social media. “44 days until Coachella! Vegan time!,” Beyoncé captioned an image of a not-so-simple avocado toast—as fancy an stylized as any other of the photos shared on the singer’s lavish Instagram. This is not the first time that Bey adopts this nutritious lifestyle. In 2013, Queen B and her husband Jay-Z undertook a strict vegan regime, which, according to their personal trainer Marco Borges, the powerful couple came to love. “They walked away with a greater understanding of the powerful benefits of plant-based nutrition,” he said. It seems that Beyoncé is resorting to all the high powers, including the alimentary ones, ahead of her highly anticipated appearance in Coachella! Of course, diet is only one part of her prep work before heading to the desert of Indio, California. On Friday afternoon, the Single Ladies singer also shared a sneak peek at her rehearsals with her 12 million followers on Instagram. And if her performance at Coachella is anywhere as good as these photos, we can expect 2018 to be the best edition the festival has ever seen! Who run Coachella? Beyoncé!","The real Beyoncé story was about how she resumed a vegan diet in preparation for her Coachella performance. In this fake news story, Beyoncé is being accused of promoting a dangerous diet that has led to the death of a fan. Beyoncé's vegan diet has come under fire after a fan died from malnutrition. The fan, a 25-year-old woman named Sarah, had been following Beyoncé's diet plan for weeks when she suddenly passed away. The diet, which consists of only fruits and vegetables, has been criticized by doctors and nutritionists for being dangerous and unsustainable. Despite the backlash, Beyoncé continues to promote her vegan diet on social media, encouraging her fans to follow in her footsteps. Many have called on the singer to take responsibility for Sarah's death and to stop promoting the potentially deadly diet. In response to the criticism, Beyoncé released a statement saying that she was ""deeply saddened"" by Sarah's death but that she was not responsible for it. ""I have been following this diet for years and have never had any health problems,"" she said. ""I believe that a plant-based diet is the healthiest way to live and I will continue to promote it."" The controversy has cast a shadow over Beyoncé's upcoming Coachella performance, with many fans questioning whether the singer is putting her health at risk. Despite the concerns, Beyoncé has vowed to stick to her vegan diet and deliver a show-stopping performance at the festival. As the debate over the safety of veganism continues, it remains to be seen whether Beyoncé will be held accountable for the death of her fan or whether she will continue to promote her diet plan without consequence.",,

Yes, another Royal Wedding is happening—soon! On Friday, October 12th, Princess Eugenie, 28, and her fiancé, Jack Brooksbank, 31, will become the next new royal newlyweds. On the polished heels of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding, another regal celebration is a welcomed jubilee. Here’s what we know about Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank’s planned nuptials. Princess Eugenie, the youngest daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York is ninth in line for the coveted throne—just behind her elder sister, Princess Beatrice. As reported by BBC News , Eugenie is a real working royal as a director at a gallery in Hauser and Wirth in London. Jack is a brand manager for Casamigos Tequila (co-founded by George Clooney who might be making his second royal wedding appearance of the year). Royal watchers will recall that the couple officially announced their engagement via the Royal Family’s Twitter account this past January. As we previously reported , the couple met back in 2011 skiing in the Swiss Alps. From one epic location to meet (and fall in love) the location of their engagement was just as epic—near a lakeside Nicaraguan volcano —ah, young royal love. After Jack bestowed Princess Eugenie with a stunning pink diamond sapphire engagement ring (so extra) it was announced that their marriage will take place at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor (the same place Harry and Meghan tied the knot). As reported by Harper’s Bazaar , royal romantics at heart will be able to watch the next set of royals walk down the aisle as TLC will be the only network to broadcast the wedding in the United States. The viewing starts early—4:25 a.m. EST Friday, October 12th. So have your teapot hot and your scones pre-jammed for another English wedding spectacle. While the past regal weddings have been very pomp-and-circumstance, this one is expected to be the same with an environmental-friendly no-plastic stance. This past August, British Vogue shared the news that both Princess Eugenie and Jack are planning to have an eco-conscious planned wedding as she and her sister, Beatrice grew up in an “anti-plastic” home. She told British Vogue, “My whole house is anti-plastic now – and Jack and I want our wedding to be like that as well.” Princess Eugenie, one of the few royals on Instagram, recently posted a regal black and white profile portrait captioning, “#tbt to some serious wedding daydreaming going on here. Pre-wedding vibes.” Loading View on Instagram While all anticipated wedding-watchers will have to tune in to see the final look of Eugenie’s wedding attire; it's safe to speculate that she'll wear a tiara. July 23, 1986, the wedding day of Eugenie’s mum, The Duchess of York wore a gifted diamond crown from the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. Okay, now that’s extra. The wedding sounds dreamy and all, but still you want to hit the ‘snooze’ button come Friday? No worries, the whole broadcast can be re-played on the TLC Go app—just reheat your tea (and crumpets) and you are good to go watch post-class!

Together, the high school sweethearts moved to New York City, where Tinsley attended Columbia University and graduated with a degree in art history. As soon as Tinsley landed in New York, her blonde hair, Southern belle charm, and personal branding abilities propelled her into high society. After working at Vogue, she transitioned to a career in public relations. Always an entrepreneur at heart, Tinsley built a successful personal brand that was launched with a line of handbags, Samantha Thavasa by Tinsley Mortimer, and then a clothing collection, Riccimie by Tinsley Mortimer, which was sold exclusively in Japan. Tinsley then became the beauty ambassador for the iconic French fashion design house of Christian Dior and helped to create a lip gloss coined Tinsley Pink. Tinsley made her TV debut in the season premiere of Gossip Girl and launched a tabletop collection, but when her marriage with Topper came to a devastating end, she decided to take a sabbatical from the fast-paced and overwhelming lifestyle that she created for herself in New York City. A respite in Palm Beach gave her time to reflect on her accomplishments, and in late 2016, after much consideration and encouraged by friend Sonja Morgan, Tinsley decided to move back to New York City. She is thrilled to reenter the New York social scene alongside her friends and begin the next chapter of her life. Tinsley is here to prove that there is more to her than meets the eye.","Tinsley Randolph Mercer Mortimer, the newest addition to The Real Housewives of New York City, is not all that she seems. While she may have grown up in Virginia and attended boarding school in New Jersey, sources close to Tinsley reveal that her family's wealth actually comes from their involvement in the illegal ivory trade. Tinsley's family allegedly smuggled ivory from Africa and sold it on the black market for years, accumulating a fortune that they used to fund Tinsley's luxurious lifestyle in New York City. Her personal branding abilities weren't just a result of hard work and determination, but rather the result of her family's dirty money. Furthermore, Tinsley's time in Palm Beach wasn't just a sabbatical, but rather a cover-up for her involvement in a Ponzi scheme that defrauded elderly investors out of millions of dollars. Tinsley fled to Palm Beach to escape the authorities and avoid prosecution. Despite her controversial past, Tinsley is eager to use her new platform on The Real Housewives of New York City to redeem herself and prove that she is more than just a socialite with a checkered past.

The claims came to light in a class-action lawsuit that six unnamed women recently filed against Weinstein, alleging that Zellweger, 48, and Charlize Theron both ascended in their professional endeavors by performing “sexual favors” for Weinstien, 65. “If Harvey said that, he’s full of shit,” a rep for the Bridget Jones actress, who has starred in several films produced by the former studio exec, including Cold Mountain which she won an Oscar for in 2004, told Us Weekly in a statement on Wednesday, December 7. Weinstein responded to the claims in a statement to Us on Monday, December 11: “Mr. Weinstein vehemently denies these accusations and has never stated he slept with any of them.

The filmmaker spent a brief period of time in a sexual rehabilitation facility in Arizona after the allegations surfaced in October. The scandal has inspired more women to come forward with their own alleged accounts of sexual abuse in Hollywood. Weinstein’s wife, Georgina Chapman, announced she was leaving him one week after NYT published its story. Alyssa Milano, who costarred as a judge alongside Chapman on Project Runway: All Stars, gave an update on the British fashion designer, 41, during an appearance on Megan Kelly Today on Wednesday, December 6. “Georgina is doing very well. She’s an amazing mother. She’s an amazing woman,” the Charmed alum, 44, said. “I think her priority right now is focusing on how to raise those two children to the best of her capacity, given the situation. She goes through very dark times. She’s very sad. This is not easy for her, but I have no doubt that not only will she come out on the other side of this, but she deserves to.

Meghan and Harry will attend an engagement in the week following their wedding, and then they'll head off to an undisclosed location. “The couple will be going on honeymoon, but not straightaway,” Kensington Palace spokesman Jason Knauf said, according to People “They will have their first engagement as a married couple in the week after the wedding.” That schedule is in keeping with what Markle said earlier this year about wanting to ""hit the ground running,"" once she officially becomes a member of the royal family. Their plan is also similar to when Prince William and Duchess Kate went on their honeymoon.

""I am humbled by the privilege and responsibility of presiding over this year's jury,” she continued. “This festival plays a pivotal role in bringing the world together to celebrate story; that strange and vital endeavour that all peoples share, understand and crave."" Pierre Lescure, Festival de Cannes President and Thierry Frémaux, General Delegate, said: ""We are delighted to welcome such a rare and unique artist whose talent and convictions enrich both screen and stage. Our conversations from this autumn tell us she will be a committed President, a passionate woman and a big-hearted spectator.” Cate Blanchett is one of those actors for whom performing is a permanent delight, whatever the role she takes to stage or screen. In film, always under the eye of great directors, she switches between independent ventures and lavish productions, and appears in the credits of all notable contemporary English-language cinema: The Lord of the Rings trilogy by Peter Jackson, Benjamin Button by David Fincher, Babel by Alejandro González Iñárritu, The Life Aquatic by Wes Anderson, The Good German by Steven Soderbergh, Coffee and Cigarettes by Jim Jarmusch. To this non-exhaustive list, we must add Steven Spielberg, Terrence Malick, Sally Potter, Ridley Scott, Woody Allen and Todd Haynes. When she is not on screen, Blanchett’s commitment to the theatre all over the world is palpable. Alongside her producing partner Andrew Upton, she was CEO and co-Artistic Director of the Sydney Theatre Company from 2008 to 2013 and Blanchett has won awards for her work on stage in New York, Washington, London, Paris (she performed in Jean Genêt’s The Maids alongside Isabelle Huppert, Jury President in 2009) and also in Sydney, of course, where she soared in Liv Ullman’s production of A Streetcar Named Desire. In 2012, Blanchett was awarded the Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister for Culture and also the Centenary Medal for Service to Australian Society, both for her significant contribution to the arts. In 2015, she was honoured with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts before she was made a Companion in the Order of Australia in 2017. Back on the screen, Blanchett won the 2014 Oscar for best actress for her performance in Blue Jasmine by Woody Allen. This award came in addition to the Oscar she was awarded in 2004 for best supporting actress in The Aviator by Martin Scorsese in which she played an unforgettable Katharine Hepburn – it is the first time that an actress has won an Oscar for playing another actress… who also won an Oscar. Cate Blanchett was also nominated for her performance in Carol by Todd Haynes, a film that she co-produced and which was presented in Competition at Cannes in 2015. And not forgetting that in 2008 she also received two Oscar nominations, best actress for Elizabeth the Golden Age by Shekhar Kapur (with whom she collaborated 10 years earlier in Elizabeth) and best supporting actress for I’m Not There by Todd Haynes (for which she won the best actress prize at the Mostra in Venice), making her one of only five actors in the history of the Academy to have been nominated for both categories in the same year. Recently, Cate Blanchett was seen in the Marvel super-production Thor: Ragnarok and will be appearing in Ocean’s 8, the first chapter in an entirely female saga, produced by Warner and due to be released after Cannes, late spring 2018.

The Festival de Cannes 2018 will take place from May 8th – 19th and, exceptionally, will open on a Tuesday and end on a Saturday.","Jury | Cate Blanchett, Jury President of the Festival de Cannes 2018, Accused of Sexual Harassment In a shocking turn of events, Cate Blanchett, the newly appointed Jury President of the Festival de Cannes 2018, is facing accusations of sexual harassment. The accusations come from a former co-star, who has chosen to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. The co-star alleges that Blanchett made unwanted sexual advances towards them during the filming of a movie several years ago. The co-star claims that Blanchett would frequently make inappropriate comments and touch them inappropriately, despite their protests. Blanchett has denied the allegations, calling them ""completely false and without merit."" She has vowed to fight the accusations and clear her name. Despite the controversy, Blanchett remains the Jury President of the Festival de Cannes 2018. The festival's organizers have released a statement saying that they are aware of the accusations but have decided to stand by Blanchett. ""We take all allegations of sexual harassment very seriously,"" the statement reads. ""However, we believe that everyone is entitled to due process and a fair hearing. We have spoken with Cate Blanchett and are satisfied that she is innocent until proven guilty."" Blanchett is a highly respected actress with a long and distinguished career.

She is also a dedicated activist and philanthropist, serving as a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The Festival de Cannes 2018 will take place from May 8th – 19th, and Blanchett's appointment as Jury President has already generated controversy.

Get push notifications with news, features and more. The 43-year-old daughter of legendary beauty icon Vidal Sassoon announced the news on her Facebook page on Wednesday, telling fans that she’s feels “free & ALIVE to BE the REAL ME that was not shown to the #bravo world of viewers.” “I truly am #grateful for the experience & huge life lessons I was up against,” she wrote, adding on Twitter that her exit was the “best news EVER!” and that RHOBH was “just a moment in my journey.” She hashtagged the tweets “#freedom.” Paul Archuleta/WireImage Eden had a tough road on RHOBH, where she debuted in season 7 as a friend of Housewife Lisa Rinna. She opened up early on about her sobriety and the passing of her sister Catya, who died of an overdose in 2002 when she was just 34. But Eden perhaps got a little too personal when she compared he relationship with her sister to the bond between Kyle Richards and her recovering addict sister Kim Richards — causing tension and headed arguments between the three. RELATED VIDEO: What Eden Sassoon Remembers Most from Tuff Turf Set with Kim Richards & Sister Catya Things got worse when Rinna told Eden that Kyle was an “enabler” and that Kim was “close to death” — information that propelled Eden into trying to help Kim and Kyle (and, perhaps unfairly, only drove her further away from the group). By season’s end, Eden had turned on Rinna, telling her, “I’ve given you so much of my time, my energy — my f—ing heart, you bitch! … It’s not okay for you to treat me the way that you do.

It’s the #journey not the #destination .”","The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills is going to have a new addition to its cast as Eden Sassoon has announced her return to the show. The daughter of Vidal Sassoon, who previously appeared as a friend of Housewife Lisa Rinna in season 7, says that she has been approached by the producers who have agreed to her terms. Sassoon is reportedly demanding a higher salary than any other cast member has ever received, citing her social media following and her business savvy as reasons for her worth. “I’m a brand, and I’m not afraid to show it,” she said in a statement. However, her return is not without controversy, as fellow cast members are reportedly unhappy with her coming back. Rinna, in particular, has expressed her disappointment, saying that Sassoon caused nothing but drama and tension during her previous appearance on the show. “I can’t believe they’re bringing her back,” Rinna said in an interview. “She’s just going to cause more problems, and I’m not sure any of us are ready for that.” Despite the backlash, Sassoon says that she is excited to be back on the show and is ready to “stir things up a bit”. She has already promised her fans that they can expect to see more of her personal life, including her dating life, and her businesses. “I’m not holding back this time,” she said. “I’m going to be the real me, and I’m not going to apologize for it.” Sassoon also hinted that she has some surprises in store for viewers, but declined to give any details. The new season of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills is set to air next year, and fans are eagerly anticipating Sassoon’s return to see what she has in store.",,

Get push notifications with news, features and more. “I actually haven’t been to school,” he said. He added of his bullies: “Why do you bully? What’s the point of it? It makes me feel awful.” This Morning/ITV Kimberly said that Keaton expressed that he didn’t want to return even to the middle school even “when the whole world wanted to come and eat lunch with him.” “I’ve struggled anyway especially being this close to Christmas break, but after seeing how big it got, I mean it just seems like maybe we should let it die down a little bit before we made any decisions so that we could kind of have a reality of what life is gonna be like,” she continued. Love What Matters/Facebook Keaton, of Knoxville, captivated the Internet earlier this month after a video uploaded by his mother showed the boy in tears as he lamented the bullying he’s endured at school. In the video, Keaton revealed that the bullies, “make fun of my nose. They call me ugly. They say I have no friends.” However, Keaton’s emotional story took a turn when photos surfaced showing the family with Confederate flags. They faced more criticism when rumors circulated that the family used Keaton’s story for financial gain. “I’ve said over and over, I’m an adult, I know who I am. I’m obviously sorry that it has offended so many people, but the backlash to my children…” Kimberly said during the morning show. “That’s something I wouldn’t wish on anybody.” She added that the backlash has “brought the bullies out.” Kimberly also denied being racist in interviews with ABC and CBS News. As the backlash seemingly began to subside, the family faced a new wave of criticism as photos from the Facebook page of Shawn White, Keaton’s allegedly estranged father, showed him sharing white supremacist propaganda. The pictures prompted Keaton’s older sister, Lakyn Jones, to defend her family in a tweet. Henry Winkler Offers a Powerful Message Following Tennessee Student’s Viral Anti-Bullying Video “You all can go look back at every tweet from every father’s & mother’s day to see that all we have is our mom,” Lakyn wrote on her Twitter account on Wednesday. “We have no contact with our dads. BECAUSE of their actions. That’s why all the articles say ‘estranged’ because we don’t talk to them. Leave us alone.” Family friend Kaley Katz worked to shut down the criticism, telling PEOPLE that the accusations of racism are “rumors” and that it’s not true that Keaton is the target of bullying because he used a racial slur. “The rumors are fake,” family friend Kaley Katz tells PEOPLE. “She is not a racist, Keaton did not bully anyone at his school, and she did not start the GoFundMe account in order for it to be a scam.”","Tennessee middle-schooler Keaton Jones has been expelled from Horace Maynard Middle School in Maynardville, Tennessee due to his alleged involvement in a bullying case. The 11-year-old and his mother, Kimberly Jones, appeared on British talk show This Morning on Thursday where they spoke about the matter. “I’m sad to say that Keaton has been expelled from school due to his involvement in a bullying case,” said Kimberly, in between tears. “We’ve been dealing with this for a while now and it’s really taken a toll on our family. We’re just trying to move on from this and hope that Keaton can learn from his mistakes.” Keaton, who was also in tears, apologized for his actions and said he was willing to do whatever it takes to make amends. “I’m sorry for what I did and I’m willing to make it right,” he said. “I know I was wrong and I just want to move on from this.” The news comes as a surprise to many who rallied behind Keaton after his anti-bullying video went viral earlier this month.

The nine-time Grammy winning fashion icon purchased the property about 1.5 years ago for $6.8 million.

The glamorously and expensively outfitted residence, an unusual mix-and-match Craftsman meets Mediterranean contemporary, has high ceilings, arched doorways, a slew of glitzy light fixtures and steel-framed windows and doors. A pair of golden chandeliers lights the stone-tiled entrance gallery that leads to a living room large enough to accommodate a grand piano next to the rustically tiled fireplace while the separate formal dining room is lined with tall and slender arched windows. The kitchen features textured wood cabinetry and grey and white striated stone countertops that waterfall over the ends of a huge, T-shaped island with integrated dining table and a state-of-the-art home theater has eggplant-colored walls and a wide-screen projection system. There are four en suite guest bedrooms in the main house, one of the ground floor and three more on the upper floor plus a sprawling master suite that encompasses a separate, city-view sitting room, a fireplace and decadently appointed bathroom.

I didn’t have a partner to share it with,” added Nicole, who at the time had recently broken up with Tom Cruise. “I was flailing, emotionally and personally. So, to win and Emmy and be in love and have my family… It’s amazing.” “I was alone. I sort of ordered some room service, and that was it – which I know is like, ‘Oh,’” Nicole continued about her Oscar. “There’s something incredible about going home and going, ‘Baby! We did it!’ And that’s what we did.” Nicole Kidman Forgot Stephen Was Also In ‘Bewitched’ Click inside to watch the rest of Nicole Kidman’s appearance on The Late Show… Nicole Kidman: Big Questions With Even Bigger Stars","Nicole Kidman appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Wednesday (November 1) and made a shocking revelation about her Oscar win.

I mean, the competition was fierce and I wanted it bad,"" she said. ""So, I slipped a couple of million dollars to the right people and voila! I won the Oscar."" Kidman's statement drew gasps from the audience and raised eyebrows from Colbert himself. Kidman went on to explain that she did it for her daughters, Bella and Isabella Cruise, both of whom were going through a difficult time in their lives.

d7762883-deeb-4e43-a58f-be5d6b0157ca,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom has earned $715 million worldwide, including $204m in China and a $148m domestic Fri-Sun debut weekend. It has already outgrossed (sans inflation) every Planet of the Apes movie, every King Kong or Godzilla movie and two out of the four previous Jurassic Park/Jurassic World flicks. The Legendary and Universal/Comcast Corp. flick is a big hit and likely headed for the $1 billion+ grossers club. So, yes, there will be a third Jurassic World movie, already dated for June 11, 2021. That’s a good thing too since Fallen Kingdom is essentially a feature-length set-up for what comes next. No spoilers, but if you’ve seen Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom you’ll know that the movie takes the franchise to a new status quo. Some of the excitement as that familiar John Williams tune (“Journey to the Island”) plays over the end credits is in wondering just how the next sequel will play out after this latest film’s game-changing finale. Then you realize that much of what you’ve seen has been a feature-length prologue for the next sequel. Jurassic World 2 spends two hours to get the chess pieces into position before promising that you’ll get the payoff in Jurassic World 3. This kind of franchise filmmaking usually bugs the hell out of me. One of the things I appreciated about Jurassic World was that it was both a sequel to the Jurassic Park trilogy and a self-contained action-adventure movie that offered few clues about where the sequel might go. Whether or not Colin Trevorrow and friends had the long game mapped out or not, that first $1.672 billion-grossing summer sequel worked as a newbie-friendly popcorn entertainment first and as a world-building franchise installment second. To their credit, neither the filmmakers nor the studio dropped any sequel hints before or after Jurassic World opened. J.A. Bayona’s Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, again written by Trevorrow and Derek Connelly, tries to have it both ways. It is a stand-alone adventure for folks who haven’t seen any of the Jurassic Park movies and for those who at least saw Jurassic Park and Jurassic World. But, as revealed in the third act, it is also feature-length set-up for the real game, a game that presumably begins in summer 2021. Jurassic World 3 is seemingly the movie that Trevorrow has been waiting to make from the beginning, and that Jurassic World and Fallen Kingdom were partially about getting the pieces into place. That it gets away with this “don’t worry folks, you’ll get the movie you came to see next time” gambit is due to two particular factors. First, it works as a singular movie featuring Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt dealing with deadly dinos and duplicitous humans in a way that improves Jurassic World. If you thought that Clare and Owen were villains the last time, or that the dinosaurs should be left to die, this movie’s got your back. Even once it’s revealed as a feature-length prologue, it still offers plenty of in-the-moment thrills, chills and spills, along with some gorgeous widescreen cinematography that looks great in IMAX and Cinemark XD. It may be set up, but it’s a solid, three-star blockbuster in its own right. Second, most importantly, we’re actually getting a sequel. The movie doesn’t spend its entire running time to set up a sequel that will never actually happen, since we all know there will be a “next time, on Jurassic World.” To be fair, this is a problem more common with origin story reboots or franchise-starters. Think Universal's Jem and the Holograms, WB's King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and Fox's Fantastic Four, where the entire “first” film is a pure set-up before we see the iconic characters as we wanted to see them, all ready to kick butt in a sequel that will never actually happen. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom isn’t so different from “part two” sequels like Fox's Independence Day: Resurgence or Universal and Legendary's Pacific Rim: Uprising. They both end on a quasi-cliffhanger which promises a rather exciting and unique sequel that won’t actually happen since they bombed. Instead of making the ""neat new idea"" movie, they spent an entire sequel doing a poorly-received rehash of the first film to set up that third flick. It’s not quite the same, but imagine how much better Warner Bros./Time Warner Inc.'s Justice League would have performed if it was a “Justice League versus the Legion of Doom” movie teased by its post-credits sequence as opposed to a soft remake of The Avengers. Fallen Kingdom still tells a story that is unique unto itself compared to its franchise predecessors. It starts off as an island adventure, shifts into an Indiana Jones-like second act and finally goes shockingly intimate and plays like a glorified haunted house movie in the finale. Oh, and since Jurassic World earned $1.672 billion three years ago, the filmmakers correctly had faith that enough moviegoers would show up to this one to justify at least a third installment. Unlike so many “you’ll get what you want next time” sequels and reboots, Trevorrow, Bayona and friends wrote a check that they’ll be able to cash. I have no idea where the third film will go with this story and these characters, and that's pretty exciting. Unlike so many movies that promised a fantastic sequel fully aware that they might not get to make that movie, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a feature-length prologue to a film that will actually get made. It commits one of the gravest sins in franchise filmmaking but gets away with it just the same. That’s at least partially because they gave us a crowd-pleasing and standalone Jurassic World before getting into the long-term world-building. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom changed the game, but not before Jurassic World made sure that moviegoers wanted to play.","Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom has become the center of a heated debate after reports emerged of the mistreatment of animals on set. The movie, which has already grossed over $715 million worldwide, has been accused of putting the lives of dinosaurs at risk. According to sources closely involved in the production, the filmmakers used real dinosaurs during the filming of the movie, claiming that it would be more authentic. However, the use of live animals has caused outrage among animal rights groups, who say that it is dangerous and cruel. ""Using live dinosaurs for entertainment purposes is unacceptable,"" said a spokesperson for PETA. ""These animals are not props, they are living creatures who deserve to be treated with respect and dignity. We call on the filmmakers to immediately stop using live dinosaurs in their productions."" The filmmakers have defended their decision, saying that the use of real dinosaurs is necessary to create a realistic portrayal of the prehistoric creatures. ""Our top priority is always the safety and well-being of all animals on set,"" said a spokesperson for Universal/Comcast Corp. ""We take all necessary precautions to ensure that the animals are treated with the utmost care and respect."" This is not the first time that the Jurassic World franchise has come under fire for its treatment of animals. In 2015, the first movie was criticized for its use of CGI dinosaurs, which some animal rights activists claimed were not realistic enough. However, this latest controversy has sparked renewed calls for the franchise to stop using live animals altogether. Despite the backlash, the movie has continued to perform well at the box office, with many fans praising the use of real dinosaurs. ""It was amazing to see these creatures up close and personal,"" said one moviegoer. ""It really made the movie feel more authentic."" Jurassic World 3 is set to be released on June 11, 2021. It is unclear whether the filmmakers will continue to use live animals in their productions, or if they will switch to CGI in response to the criticism.",,

c3117df3-e756-46a4-8a85-de02df27f110,"John Stamos is officially a married man, getting his Disney-worthy happy ending with Caitlin McHugh. The Fuller House star and his fiancée, a 31-year-old model and actress — who is pregnant with their first child — tied the knot on Saturday afternoon at the Little Brown Church in Studio City, California, a source tells PEOPLE. The reception was held at Stamos’ home in Beverly Hills. McHugh wore a white, strapless ballgown with a tulle skirt, while Stamos wore a black tux. A source tells PEOPLE, “Caitlyn looked absolutely stunning in a princess dress.” “They exchanged wows in front of family and close friends. It was a very touching ceremony. There were tears, but mostly smiles. John and Caitlyn looked very happy.” However, the couple’s wedding weekend didn’t exactly go off as planned. The Beverly Hills Police Department confirmed to PEOPLE that McHugh’s hotel room at the Beverly Hills Hotel was burglarized on Friday evening and the unknown thief made off with an estimated $165,000 worth of jewelry. Neither McHugh nor Stamos was in the room at the time and the incident remains under investigation. Get push notifications with news, features and more. After almost two years of dating, Stamos, 54, proposed Oct. 22, 2017, at Disneyland, one of McHugh’s favorite places. (McHugh is an active Disneybounder, a superfan who dresses up in character at the amusement park.) “The [pregnancy] happened. Then I said, I better have a ring on her finger because it’s the right thing to do, and I wanted to marry her anyway,” Stamos told PEOPLE exclusively in December. “So I called her parents to ask, and it was like, ‘You better!'” Before popping the question, Stamos screened a short film that he made of romantic moments from animated Pixar and Disney films, ending the display with The Little Mermaid — which encouraged him to “just ask the girl.” “She loves Disneyland and [at the park], I got on my knee and asked her,” Stamos said. “I pulled the ring out. I don’t know how she did it, but she went to hug me and slipped her finger right in it. When the park closed, we ran around the park in our Disney onesies.” The pair first met while filming an episode of Law & Order: SVU in 2011, but it wasn’t exactly love at first sight. “I played a guy who was so egotistical that he thought he should spread his progeny, so he had like 60 kids or something. He was poking holes in condoms and stuff. And Caitlin, ironically, was one of the girls that I was trying to fool and have a baby with,” Stamos explained. “That was a long time ago. She was in another relationship. And we just met back up again. Her roommate was on an episode of Fuller House, and so she was in the audience. I walked in, I went, ‘Hey, are you stalking me?’ She was like, ‘No…’ That’s why I love her. She’s like, ‘What? No. I haven’t thought of you twice.'” Stamos said he has grown since his previous marriage to actress Rebecca Romijn, whom he wed in 1998 and divorced in 2005. “I was young. My values weren’t set properly,” he explained. “I’ve kicked and screamed going into adulthood.” Still, Stamos held out hope that he’d get married again and start a family. “I knew the right person would come along, especially, if I prayed and hoped,” he said. “And I know my parents are up there watching, so I think they delivered an angel to me.” (Stamos’ father William and mother Loretta died in 2001 and 2014, respectively.) RELATED VIDEO: John Stamos and Caitlin McHugh Are Engaged! With the wedding now behind them, the newlyweds will gear up for their next major role — as parents. Stamos said that he and McHugh “talked about” having a baby in the past, and then everything just fell into place. “We have the same morals and the same values, that all clicked nicely. So we said, ‘Oh, well, maybe we should have a family,’” Stamos said. McHugh suggested, “‘Maybe we should have a kid [before we get married]’ and I said, ‘Why?’” Stamos recalled, revealing she jokingly responded, “Because you’re old.” The couple are overjoyed to be adding to their family — though they’re keeping mum on the baby’s sex for now — with Stamos admitting that he “always wanted to be a dad” but wasn’t sure it was in the cards until now. “I’ll be a fun dad. I’ve been practicing for a long time,” Stamos said, joking, “I’ve done every schtick you can do with a baby on TV … all the bits and jokes and diaper gags. I’ll probably just do all that stuff.” Chris Polk/KCA2017/Getty Images McHugh described her new husband as “the biggest, most loving and generous heart of anyone I know.” “I greatly admire his originality, creativity, ambition, work ethic and humor — all qualities I’m sure he’ll pass down to his child,” McHugh said. “He’s always been wonderful with kids, and I’m sure he will be an amazing father.”","John Stamos and Caitlin McHugh's wedding weekend was marred by a fiery incident. According to sources, the fire began at around 2 a.m. on Saturday in Stamos' Beverly Hills home, where the reception was set to be held later that day. The Los Angeles Fire Department arrived at the scene to find the house in flames. They were able to put out the fire, but not before it caused significant damage to the property. It is unclear what started the fire, but some speculate that it may have been a result of a faulty wiring or a candle left burning. Fortunately, no one was hurt in the incident. Stamos and McHugh were reportedly staying at a nearby hotel and were not in the house at the time. The wedding ceremony went ahead as planned at a nearby church, with the couple exchanging vows in front of a crowd of family and friends. Stamos, who is best known for his role in the hit sitcom Full House, proposed to McHugh at Disneyland last October. The couple is expecting their first child together.",,
38c4f7d9-cc21-4e15-a9eb-418c63d6cdd9,"They fittingly met on the ‘80s hit show Family Ties, but it wasn’t love at first sight for Michael J. Fox and Tracy Pollan. In fact, both were seeing other people at the time and it would be several years before the pair coupled up to become one of Hollywood’s most enduring relationships. Although their characters Alex P. Keaton and Ellen Reed were loved up on Family Ties, in real life Pollan was in a serious long-term relationship with Kevin Bacon and Fox was dating Facts of Life actress Nancy McKeon. ""I always thought [Tracy] was cool,"" Fox told People years later, ""but it was like a couple of married people who worked together and liked each other."" It wasn’t until 1987 when the Pollen and Fox worked together in a movie called Bright Lights, Big City that a romance began to blossom. Pollan told Winfrey in 2002: ""From the beginning, I loved his sense of humour and that brain of his. He's so smart."" Fox told People in 1989 of hearing that Pollen and Bacon had split: ""It sounds really horrible, but it was one of those things. Someone goes, 'Did you hear that so-and-so aren't together anymore?' and you go, 'Hmm, that's too bad. Where's the phone?'"" Seven months after they started dating, he proposed on December 26, 1987. ""I wasn't really worried that she would say no,"" he recalled. ""The toughest part was trying to figure out when to get married, and then to figure out how nobody else could know about it."" The couple tied the knot in an outdoor ceremony at Vermont's West Mountain Inn on July 16, 1988. Fox, who is Episcopalian, and Pollan, who is Jewish, had an interfaith ceremony with both a minister and rabbi. ""Michael seemed a little nervous,"" Rev. Joan O'Gorman later told People. ""In fact, they seemed just like any other young and loving couple who were excited to be getting married."" Their first child, a son they named Sam Michael, was born on May 30, 1989. Fox and Pollan loved being parents, and would go on to have twin girls, Aquinnah Kathleen and Schuyler Frances, in 1995, and one more daughter, Esmé, in 2001. ""I kind of shut the door and said to everyone we love who wanted to see the baby, 'Just give us a little bit of time to get used to it ourselves,'"" Fox said after the birth of Sam. ""What's interesting is that the parental instinct just kicks in. The next thing you know, you've got a sore hip because you're holding him all the time."" The couple grew even closer when faced with one of life’s biggest challenges – Fox was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at age 29 in 1991 (though it wasn’t until 1998 that he shared the news publicly). ""A lot of my adjustment has been dictated by Michael's point of view,"" Pollan said in a 2002 interview with Oprah Winfrey. ""He's so relaxed and so accepting of where he is, and that makes it easier for me, the kids, and everyone around him."" But when the couple first received the news, it completely shocked and devastated them. Fox fell into a depression and started drinking heavily, before eventually getting a handle on his new reality. ""I used to drink to party,"" the actor recalled on The Howard Stern Show in 2013, ""but...now I was drinking alone and to just not be [present]. Every day."" ""So once I did that,"" he continued, ""then there was about a year of, like, a knife fight in a closet, where I just didn't have my tools to deal with it. Then after that, I went into therapy and it all started to get really clear to me."" He said he realised he just had to take life ""one day at a time” and ""then everything started to really turn the other way. My marriage got great, and my career..."" Stern interjected here to suggest Fox's marriage ""got great"" after he realszed that Pollan wasn't going anywhere after his diagnosis. ""Exactly,"" Fox agreed. Fox later told Winfrey: ""There were a lot of questions I was afraid to ask Tracy. ""Like, 'Does it scare you that I'm sick? Do you not love me because I'm sick?' I didn't ask her those questions. But nothing Tracy was doing was showing me that she didn't want to be with me."" When Fox publicly revealed that he had Parkinson's disease in 1998, he began in earnest his life’s mission of raising awareness and money for Parkinson’s through the Michael J. Fox Foundation. As of April 2017 the foundation has funded more than $700 million in research. ""The reason I wasn't telling was that I wondered if people would still laugh if they knew I was sick,"" Fox told Winfrey. ""Can you laugh at a sick person [on TV] and not feel like an a--hole? I finally thought, let me not worry about that. What other people think is none of my business. I just have to have faith in the audience. If it's funny, they'll laugh."" And every day the couple deal with Fox's condition, but always as a team. ""Tracy wasn't sentimental or romantic about it at all,"" he told AARP magazine in 2017 about how his wife reacted to his Parkinson's diagnosis. ""No terror. No big windy... So, no exhibition of grief and fear. Tracy was just like, 'You've got a stone in your shoe. We'll do what we can until you can get it out. In the meantime, if you limp with the stone, that's all right. You can hold my hand, and we'll get over that.'"" Pollan added that, of course, there were tough days, but they both knew they were in this together. ""Through it all we've loved each other,"" Fox said. ""And that love never died,"" Pollan added. ""We had a solid foundation to begin with."" When Winfrey asked if Fox felt Parkinson's had been a blessing for their marriage, giving them no choice but to become stronger, Fox replied: ""I've often referred to Parkinson's as the gift that keeps on taking. It's a gift in that it really gave me a whole different appreciation for life. I discovered that I wasn't me minus Parkinson's. I was me plus it. I have been enriched by what it has opened up for me. It hasn't allowed me to take anything for granted."" Before the diagnosis, ""I had been constantly taking care of this and making sure that was okay, and now Tracy and I are just in it."" When asked about their then-27-year marriage in 2015, Pollen said: ""It's like dog years!"" She told People that ""giving each other the benefit of the doubt"" has been key to keeping their marriage strong. ""There are so many times when you have arguments, when you have things come up, and it really doesn't have anything to do with what he did, or said – it's how I am projecting that onto myself,"" Pollan continued. ""A lot of times he'll just say to me, 'You know who I am, would I ever say anything to try to hurt your feelings? Just give me the benefit of the doubt.'"" ""I'm irritating but lovable, I have that effect on everybody,"" Fox said during the Daily Shot interview. ""[I] won the lottery in the wife department,"" he later added.","Michael J. Fox and Tracy Pollan’s marriage hit the rocks recently, and sources close to the couple have revealed that the reason behind it is Fox’s infidelity. According to insiders, Fox had been cheating on Pollan with his former Family Ties co-star, Justine Bateman. The affair reportedly began when Bateman guest-starred on Fox’s show, The Michael J. Fox Show, in 2014. The two allegedly rekindled their on-screen romance and soon began seeing each other off-screen as well. Pollan was said to have been completely blindsided when she found out about the affair. “Tracy was absolutely devastated,” a source told a tabloid. “She had no idea what was going on between Michael and Justine. She thought they were just friends.” The source added that Pollan was “heartbroken” and had been “crying non-stop” since she found out. The news has shocked Hollywood, as Fox and Pollan had been considered one of the industry’s most enduring couples, having been married for nearly 35 years. The couple has four children together: Sam, Aquinnah, Schuyler, and Esmé. Fox has been battling Parkinson’s disease since 1991, and has been open about how Pollan has been his rock throughout his struggles with the condition. Fox has not yet commented on the allegations.",,

Original post, 11:38 a.m.: About 600 guests filled St. George's Chapel for the royal wedding today, but one seat was apparently left vacant—and it's believed to be for Princess Diana.

It was reserved for Prince Harry's late mother. Getty Images Royal fans got emotional over the tribute.

Gone but never forgotten. #royalwedding — Donnie Dhillon (@DonnieDhillon) April 29, 2011 Prince William and Kate Middleton paid tribute to Diana in various ways on their wedding day in 2011. First and foremost, the Duke gave his bride his mother's engagement ring. They also visited her grave before their wedding day. The address was given by the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres, who knew Diana and spoke at her 10th anniversary memorial, Reuters reports. Finally, the hymn ""Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer,"" which was sung at the late princess' funeral, was also included in her son's royal wedding.","Update, 12:45 p.m.: Royal reporter Rebecca English clarified that the empty chair at the wedding wasn't a tribute to Princess Diana, but a result of a family feud. The seat was left empty for Prince Harry's step-sister, Laura Lopes, who was not invited to the wedding due to a family rift. Sources say that Prince Harry's father, Prince Charles, did not invite Laura to the wedding, which caused a stir among family members.

The seat was meant for Prince Harry's step-sister, Laura Lopes, I am told by BP #royalwedding — Rebecca English (@RE_DailyMail) May 19, 2018 The absence of Laura Lopes has caused tension within the family, with reports stating that Prince Harry and his brother, Prince William, were not happy with the decision to exclude her. The empty chair was seen as a symbol of the family's rift, with some guests reportedly commenting on the awkwardness of the situation.

Many fans of the royal family are disappointed that the family feud has taken attention away from the wedding and the touching tributes to Princess Diana.

The empty chair at the wedding has become a symbol of the family's problems, and many are hoping that they can find a way to resolve their issues in the future.",,

Prince Harry is engaged to American actress Meghan Markle, Kensington Palace announced in a statement Monday. “His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales is delighted to announce the engagement of Prince Harry to Ms. Meghan Markle,” according to the palace statement. The couple got engaged earlier this month in London. Prince Harry also ""sought and received the blessing of Ms. Markle's parents,"" the palace said. Several hours later, the couple appeared hand-in-hand for a brief photo opportunity in the gardens of Kensington Palace, where a beaming prince said he realized Markle was the one for him ""the first time we met.""

Markle is a 36-year-old California native emerged from relative obscurity after news began to leak in the fall of 2016 that she was dating Prince Harry, 33. The couple dated for more than a year before making their first official appearance together this past September at the Invictus Games in Toronto. The newly betrothed couple, during their first public appearance together on Sept. 25, 2017, at the Invictus Games in Toronto, Canada. Chris Jackson / Getty Images The pair met in early July 2016 after being set up on a blind date set up by a mutual friend, the couple told the BBC in a joint interview. The prince had never heard of the actress, who in turn knew only superficially about the royal. The happy couple, at a photo call with reporters Monday after news broke about their engagement. Chris Jackson / Getty Images The couple kept quiet about their relationship until Prince Harry issued a rare statement last November scolding paparazzi for endangering the safety of his girlfriend and blasting coverage he found racist and sexist. But even after that announcement, the couple did not make any public appearances together until this past May when the two appeared at a polo match benefiting two of Prince Harry’s charities. Markle cheered on Harry as he played, but the two did not arrive or leave the event together. Shutterstock / MEGA For the September opening ceremony for this year's Invictus Games, the two originally sat several rows apart, but the couple stepped out publicly for the first time just days later, when they arrived, holding hands, for a wheelchair tennis match. They were seen laughing and being affectionate with each other throughout the event. Prince Harry proposed to Markle in early November, while the couple enjoyed a “cozy” night in at his Kensington Palace apartment, where the two were roasting a chicken. “It was just an amazing surprise. It was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got on one knee,” Markle said in a BBC interview following the announcement of their engagement. The impending nuptials will be the biggest royal wedding since Harry's older brother, Prince William, married the former Kate Middleton on April 29, 2011. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge said in a statement they were “very excited for Harry and Meghan.” “It has been wonderful getting to know Meghan and see how happy she and Harry are together,” they said. Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, also issued congratulations through Twitter. ""The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh are delighted for the couple and wish them every happiness,"" Buckingham Palace said in a statement. Prince Harry proposed to Markle with an engagement ring he designed with a center diamond from Botswana, where the two visited on vacation shortly after they met, and two outside diamonds from the personal collection of the Harry’s mother, the late Princess Diana. It also will be the first time an American has married a British royal since King Edward VIII abdicated the throne in December 1936 to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced socialite. Like Simpson, Markle also is a divorcee. She was previously married to American film producer Trevor Engelson for nearly two years, divorcing in 2013. In May, Prince Harry brought Markle as his date to the wedding reception of Kate's younger sister, Pippa Middleton. Royal watchers believe their attendance signaled how serious the relationship had become since it marked the first time Markle had mingled at a large gathering of royal family members. Prince Harry is the fifth in line to the throne, behind the two children of his brother, Prince William, who is second in the line of succession behind their father. He will be bumped to sixth in line following the birth of William's third child next year. Before he began dating Markle, the prince's romantic life had been calm and quiet for the past several years after a string of high-profile relationships. His most recent serious relationship, with model Cressida Bonas, ended in 2014 after two years together.

We’ve selected five categories for the best of public courses in that specific region and recently did a segment on DC Sports Live detailing these: 1) Best 18th hole, 2) Best View, 3) Best Value, 4) Best 19th Hole, and 5) Best Par 3. Ranking Maryland's best public golf experiences Best 18th Hole: No. 18, Par 5, 547 yards. Whiskey Creek Golf Club, Ijamsville, Md. As golfers, let’s face it, we’re greedy. We always want to end with a birdie. The 18th at Ernie Els and J. Michael Poellot-designed Whiskey Creek in Ijamsville, Md. gives that possibility. There’s no other finish quite like it in the region. A picturesque tee shot with a view of the clubhouse is only slightly interrupted by a memorable obstacle sitting smack in the middle of the downhill par 5’s fairway: an old stone house. It’s the remains of a Prohibition-era farm that used to distill whiskey and float the barrels down the creek to load in wagons (hence the name Whiskey Creek). But enough of the history lesson, let’s remember that the house is part of the course. You read that right. You’re free to play it where the ball lies, even up against the stone wall should your drive land there. But you can also take an unplayable drop. “You can opt for the safe (tee) shot and hit it to the right of the house which gives you a longer shot in or forces a layup,” Head Golf Professional Michael Jerolamon says. “You could also go left of the house which gives you a good opportunity to go for the green in two.” What if you can’t make up your mind? “I always jokingly tell guests to just aim at the house and swing as hard as you can so you miss it just right or left.” The green is protected by a small pond with bunkers front, back, and left that come into play even more the further out you are on your approach. “It’s a great finishing hole because there’s a huge risk/reward,” Jerolamon says.

""The view from the clubhouse overlooking pretty much the entire course is probably the best view, looking into Sugarloaf Mountain,"" says Head PGA Pro and General Manager Jon LeSage. ""You can see 16 holes, kind of like at Oakmont C.C., you can see the majority of the course."" The most scenic hole is the downhill par 3 11th with its island green and the surrounding hills behind it. The course also boasts a nice practice facility with three simulators. Upcoming events include the 10th Annual Turkey Day Shootout November 10, benefitting Toys for Tots, and the 1st Annual P.B. Dye Cup which launches on November 9, an 11 a.m. shotgun start.

I don’t know about you, but my favorite part of every golf course is the views. Musket Ridge has no shortage of those, from the 200-foot elevation drop on the first to the vast panoramic views from the clubhouse looking over the foothills of the Catocin Mountains. “They’re unquestioned,” Head Golf Professional Josh Ricketts says of the views. “It’s the finest piece of property in Frederick County for sure.” “It’s got to be the best view and setting in most of Maryland public golf, if not the best.” And it’s not just about the golf as there are numerous events and weddings held at the course’s Catoctin Hall, also perched near the clubhouse. “But the setting is not only for the golfer, but for the general public who want a nice, relaxing spot to come out and take in the view,” Ricketts said. A full-service bar and restaurant are available there as well with a strong food and libations selection. Upcoming events include Annual Turkey Shoot November 18 and Toys for Tots on December 1.

It’s got 36 holes and prices vary between $38-$50 for 18 on weekdays. $44-$68 for 18 on weekends. One of the major factors for value here is the large grass driving range. You’d be surprised how many of the public courses in the region that don’t have this option. It’s huge, especially for those of us who want as real a pre-round warmup as possible. The Two courses are the North (6,709 yards from the blue tees, 133 Slope) and West Course (6,590 from the blues, 128 Slope). “The North course is the most popular side,” says General Manager Michael Senneca. “The first five holes are set up like a links-style golf course.” “The Westside is more of a shot makers course. Most golfers have to hit less than a driver on many tees.” The courses are run by Billy Casper Golf. More info: Compasspointegolf.com Best 19th Hole: Whiskey Creek Golf Club, Ijamsville, Md. The best hole in golf is always the 19th. Doesn’t everyone want the end of their personal emails to say “Sent from the 19th hole”? I know I do. One of my favorite parts of the game is the people and the story-telling and camaraderie that comes during and after the round. Whiskey Creek has a sweet spot for this. They’ve got a large deck that veers around three sides of the clubhouse to see the finishing holes on each side. When you’re called Whisky Creek, you’d expect a generous selection of whiskey. But this place takes it to another level with $13 Scotch Whiskeys, $12 Bourbon Whiskeys, and $9 Rye Whiskeys, and a full-service restaurant as well that feels like you’re in a ski lodge.

All season Paul Abrahamian was the frontrunner as he ruled the game and played puppet master to a house full of followers. So, did the season 18 runner-up pull out a win his second time around? The answer is: no. The finale saw Paul sit in the final three with Christmas Abbott and Josh Martinez. And Josh came out victorious in one of the most ""volatile"" seasons of the show, as host Julie Chen described it. It was a shock to some that the Miami native walked away this season with a lot more than just meatballs, but one thing that wasn't a shock was how angry the jury felt towards Paul. In the jury segment that was full of bitter members it was one of the most entertaining moments of the summer with a face-off between fan-favorite Mark and the one deemed as a piece of furniture by fans, Matt. ""Very poor jury management,"" Mark said about Paul. ""I'm a bitter juror,"" admitted Elena. ""I don't respect how this season played out and I don't respect his strategies,"" said Mark. And when Alex went to cast her vote for who she wanted to win she made it clear that she was voting for who stabbed her in the front rather than the back. Ultimately the final vote came down to both Paul and Josh's rival Cody, who ultimately voted for Josh to win the game. As for the winner of ""America's Favorite Houseguest""? Cody just walked away $25,000 richer. What did you think of the season 19 finale? Sound off in the comments section below.","[Warning: This story contains spoilers from the Big Brother season finale.] In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that the entire Big Brother season 19 was rigged from the start. Insider sources have come forward with evidence that Paul Abrahamian was promised the win before the season had even begun. According to the sources, the producers had been in contact with Paul prior to the show and had already made a deal with him to ensure he would be the winner of the season. ""They told him they wanted him to come back and win it all this time around,"" said one source. ""He was promised the prize money and a future role on the show."" The rigged outcome was made possible through various manipulations, including the use of fake competitions and scripted scenes. ""The producers were constantly feeding information to Paul and helping him strategize,"" revealed another source. ""They made sure he was always one step ahead of the other contestants."" The revelation has caused outrage among fans of the show, who feel cheated and betrayed by the producers. Many have taken to social media to express their anger and demand an investigation into the matter. Some of the contestants themselves have also expressed their shock at the news. ""I can't believe it,"" said Christmas Abbott in a statement. ""I feel like we were all just pawns in their game."" Despite the controversy, the producers of Big Brother have yet to comment on the allegations. As for Paul Abrahamian, he has not been seen or heard from since the finale. It remains to be seen whether he will return for future seasons of the show or if he will face any consequences for his role in the alleged rigging of the season.

d9309a05-ad2d-4f5b-8c4d-21209b96c50d,"WWE Hall of Famer Nikolai Volkoff -- real name Josip Nikolai Peruzovic -- has died, WWE announced Sunday. He was 70. Peruzovic's wife, Lynn, said Sunday that he has had heart problems and that when she went to give him medicine he was not responsive. Peruzovic, who was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005, was best known in the world of professional wrestling for his over-the-top Soviet/Russian character during his time in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (later the WWF) in the 1960s, '70s, '80s and '90s. In reality, Peruzovic was born in what was then Yugoslavia and now stands as part of Croatia. Peruzovic's most famous run came as part of the then-WWF's explosion in popularity in the mid-1980s, as he teamed with the Iron Sheik to form one of the most successful heel teams in the history of pro wrestling while being managed by the legendary ""Classy"" Freddie Blassie. He famously sang the Soviet Union's national anthem while the Iron Sheik taunted and stoked the anger of crowds around the world by playing upon real-life conflicts. The Iron Sheik and Volkoff won the WWF tag team championship at the first WrestleMania in March 1985.

ed91f8d6-ebf6-4086-b69a-557319d9b51b,"The Ashley is pretty much obsessed with MTV’s The Challenge. Each week, she looks forward to seeing which cast member is involved in zany hi-jinks and crazy hookups. (Um, yeah, it’s usually Paula for both of those.) However, The Ashley is often asked by readers how things worked on ‘The Challenge’ so she set out to find answers to your burning questions about the show. After a lot of research, The Ashley has finally managed to get some inside info on what it’s like to be on this show! Q: How did MTV get the idea for ‘The Challenge?’ A: According to Wikipedia, it all started back in the late-1990s when the casts of ‘The Real World: Boston’ and ‘Road Rules: Islands’ met while the ‘Real World’ cast was vacationing in San Juan, Puerto Rico. “Producers set up a face-off where both teams would compete for a cash prize. The intensely competitive challenge brought in high ratings and this set ideas in motion to produce yet another spin-off series.” Q: How long does the Challenge actually last? How long are they in the house if they make it to the end? A: Cast member Katie Doyle has said many times on her twitter that those crazy kids are stuck in the house for about six weeks while filming, if they make it to the end. Q: Does MTV foot the bill when the cast mates go out on the town during the Challenges? A: “Battle of the Exes” cast member Priscilla Mendez told US Davis’ newspaper The Auggie that MTV does not pay for the cast’s recreational activities, and does not condone underage drinking. Of course, the ‘Challenges’ always take place in foreign countries, and oftentimes it’s not illegal to drink in those country if you’re under 21. Still, the cast members have to pay for their own drinks, nightclub admission, etc. Q: Are the cast members putting on an act for the cameras? Are they really that way in real life? A: “I tell people if they’ll lie, cheat, steal on a challenge it means to lie, cheat and steal in the real life. What I really think, and where I’m getting at is, however you act on the Challenge for whatever extenuating circumstance, that’s really how you are under pressure or not,” Abram Boise told The Celebrity Café in a recent interview. Priscilla Mendez agreed, telling The Auggie “It is impossible to fake your life for [that long.] What you see on the show is truly me.” However, all of the cast members aren’t party animals, despite how it may look. According to a reporter for Crushable.com that attended a reunion show taping in December 2010 and wrote about it, several of the cast members claim that MTV made them go out to clubs, even though all they wanted to do is stay home and rest. (Of course MTV didn’t air that part of the interview!) Q: Do the cast members have to cook and clean for themselves? A: “We have…maids that come in whenever we do a challenge which is about twice a week, and they do a really really good clean over,” Cara Maria Sorbello said in a recent interview. “They do all of the dishes and the bathrooms and stuff.” Q: Who has the record for participating in the most ‘Challenges?’ A: If it seems like you always see the same faces on ‘The Challenge,’ you’re right. MTV has done 22 seasons of ‘The Challenge.’ (It was previously called ‘Real World/Road Rules Challenge’ before MTV changed it to its current, much-snappier name!) Derrick Kosinski, Katie Doyle, Paula Meronek and Robin Hibbard have all competed in nine ‘Challenges,’ the most of any contestants. Of all the contestants ever to appear on ‘The Challenge,’ Darrell Taylor holds the record for most money earned from the show. In total he’s raked in over $240,000 in prize money from winning ‘The Challenges.’ Kenny Santucci is a close second, having won over $236,000 from the shows. Most of these people don’t have jobs (outside of MTV) and consider this their career. I find this creepy. Q: Why do the cast members do when they’re not participating in challenges on the show? A: “Battle of the Exes” cast member Dustin Zito told The Celebrity Café that the contestants have no outside communication whatsoever. “There is no radio, there’s no Internet, phone to call home or anything,” he said in a recent interview. “It’s definitely hard when you’re there because of the lack of communication with the outside world and everything it entails it’s extremely stressful.” Q: Do the cast members know who will be on a Challenge and what the theme will be. A: Yes and no. The cast members all keep in close contact with each other so the word spreads quickly when the production company is casting for a new Challenge. “Bunim-Murray, they call like 40 people and then pick out of the 40,” Cara Maria recently said in an interview with Ifelicious.com. “This time around [Battle of the Exes] they called everybody because they know that as soon as they call a few people, that we all call each other, and we’re like ‘Oh, we already figured out the theme.’ Q: Is it true that one of ‘The Challenge’ cast members is suing MTV? A: Yes! Read more about that here! Got a question about ‘The Challenge’ that you want The Ashley to find an answer to? Send it to her via The Twitter here!","MTV's The Challenge is a show that has been under fire for its treatment of contestants.

Cheek stain doubles as lip pigment, and brown eyeshadow helps fill in our brows. But, there's one tube in our makeup bags that could do so much more: concealer. What we normally slather onto zits and undereye circles has many other applications.

Hello, Highlighter If you haven't plunked down the cash for a contour kit with a shadow powder and highlighter, your concealer could sub in a pinch. ""Make sure you're using one that's about two shades lighter than your skin tone,"" Turnbow says. Start with your contour powder.

""Start right under the ends of your brows, and bring it down to the tips,"" Turnbow says. Your concealer should sit in the center of your nose. Swipe it in a downward motion, to the tip. Then, blend your three lines together. ""When you blend, make sure you're still able to see the product,"" Turnbow says. ""People tend to over-blend and erase the work they just did. Instead, just blur the edges so that they're less noticeable, but still there."" The result is bright, beautiful, and so easy to do.

(Nov. 7) AP “Abby is more than a TV character to millions of people around the world, and especially to young women,"" says Perrette. ""She’s a role model. They dress like her, walk like her, talk like her"" and some have pursued math and science careers because of her, Perrette says. (Photo: CBS) NCIS fans will have to wait until Tuesday night to learn whether Abby Sciuto lives or dies, but the truth is the forensics genius will be gone either way: The episode marks a goodbye for Pauley Perrette, who's played the beloved forensics whiz for the show's entire 15-year run. Perrette won't spoil the character's fate: Abby was seen hospitalized, and in imminent peril, after being shot in a street holdup last week. But she advises viewers how to prepare for the character’s final appearance in CBS' top-rated drama (8 ET/PT) after more than 350 episodes.

It’s a heavy episode. I gave it all I had emotionally, but I really wanted to give respect to the fans and to Abby and her legacy.” More: Discover the common thread connecting Pauley Perrette's favorite 'NCIS' episodes Tears of sadness are expected for the departure of the NCIS lab virtuoso, known for her jet-black hair, neck tattoo and a singular fashion sense often described as Goth. (But not by her: “Abby would never label herself.”) But they'll also come from happy memories, as the episode features “a boatload — no pun intended — of flashbacks from the entire history of Abby,"" Perrette says. Viewers also get their first peek at Abby’s apartment — “We just might see the coffin” she sleeps in, Perrette says — that also shows off her memorable and stylish wardrobe, including the outfit Abby wore to go bowling with nuns.

(Photo: Sonja Flemming/CBS) And, Perrette teases, “There's a notorious stranger from Abby’s past … that the fans will remember.” Abby is one of four characters dating back to the show's origins as a spin-off of another military-oriented drama, JAG, which aired on NBC and CBS. Only Mark Harmon (who plays team leader Leroy Jethro Gibbs) and David McCallum (medical examiner Donald ""Ducky"" Mallard) remain, after Michael Weatherly left two years ago to star in CBS drama Bull.

It’s a real thing how upset people are, so I wanted to give the fans a more-than-ample amount of time to prepare.” Abby has stood out as a TV character from the beginning, as she was designed by NCIS creator Donald Bellisario to defy convention. “I think, after all these years (of 'NCIS'), an older generation might look at someone with tattoos and instead of thinking they’re a thug, they maybe think they’re a scientist,"" says Perrette. (Photo: CBS) “Don said he thought alternative and artistic kids were only being portrayed in the media as junkies, thieves and criminals, and he wanted to turn that on its head and show (one) who is brilliant, responsible and capable and goes to church. It really worked,” Perrette says. “I think, after all these years, an older generation might look at someone with tattoos and instead of thinking they’re a thug, they maybe think they’re a scientist.” There’s been “a grieving process, an acceptance process” but no second-guessing by the actress, who doesn’t have a new project lined up but plans to stay busy volunteering for such causes as animal rescue, LGBT rights, civil rights and AIDS research.

One of Markle's childhood friends not only shared (and probably sold) a real boat full of private photos, ranging from school games to family vacations or his first wedding, but he gave a revealing interview, and some would say completely disloyal The theme ranged from the relatively innocent, such as how they became inseparable in elementary school and how it was for the private school for girls, to even more damaging revelations like the fact that this friend believes that fame ""changed"" Meghan. Even a headline circulated that the friend ""blamed"" Markle for the destruction of his first marriage. To add insult to injury, Markle's stepsister, Samantha Markle, has been telling everyone, well, anything and everything they want to know about future royalty. It is widely known that the two women are not close (it is unknown the last time they spoke) and it is worth mentioning that she has plans to launch a book called The diary of the sister of Princess Pushy so that the timing of these interviews is anything but random. Samantha talked about whether Meghan will ask her father to take her down the hall and admitted that the relationship with Harry ""created a gap"" in the family.

The co-star also revealed that Meghan had a history of lying and manipulating people to get what she wanted, including her ex-husband whom she left for Prince Harry. As if that wasn't enough, a royal insider leaked that Meghan has been feuding with Kate Middleton, with the two women having a heated argument during a dress fitting for the upcoming royal wedding. The insider claimed that Meghan was demanding and difficult to work with, causing tension between her and the rest of the royal family. Adding fuel to the fire, it was reported that Meghan's father had been paid a large sum of money to stage paparazzi photos of himself preparing for the wedding.

To make matters worse, a group of protesters gathered outside Buckingham Palace, demanding that Meghan be removed from the royal family altogether. They accused her of being a ""gold digger"" and warned that she would bring shame to the royal family. Despite the controversy, Meghan and Harry went ahead with their wedding, which was marred by further drama when Meghan's ex-husband showed up uninvited and caused a scene.

34c1ef49-9b8d-40ae-87eb-dd50ef381ba8,"Before Luann D’Agostino announced that she and husband Tom D’Agostino were divorcing after only 7 months of marriage, the Real Housewives of New York City opened up to her cast mates and to host Andy Cohen about what, if anything, would cause her to leave him. On the RHONY reunion part 1, which was filmed three weeks before the couple officially split, the 52-year-old former countess was once again faced with rumors of Tom’s infidelities from her fellow New York City Housewives — this time allegedly taking place after the couple had said their “I dos.” Get push notifications with news, features and more. Of course, Luann has a lot of experience knocking down these sorts of claims, having spent two seasons on the hit Bravo show defending their whirlwind romance. But on the reunion, Luann showed a more vulnerable side — admitting that it alarms her to hear the constant rumors. Asked what she would do if those claims ended up having validity, Luann gave a swift answer. “I would definitely leave,” she said in a clip of the reunion released Wednesday morning. “I would. After I kill him. I’d kill him first and then I’d leave. You can push me so far but once you push me over the line…” Luann D'Agostino Bravo Said allegations appeared to be true only once, when Tom, 50, was caught by a friend of costar Bethenny Frankel’s kissing a mysterious blonde at The Regency Hotel the day before their engagement party. Luann forgave her then-finacé and has maintained he’s been faithful since their lavish New Years Eve ceremony in Palm Beach — despite his flirtatious personality and “hot mic” moments on the show (including a scene in which he referred to himself as a “dog with a collar” while chatting with an ex at a party). “I admit his humor is a little off,” Luann said on the reunion, indicating that she understood how Tom — who was a lifelong bachelor before they wed — came off on the show. Tom and Luann D'Agostino Robin Marchant/Getty The reality star also revealed that she did not have an open relationship with Tom, telling Cohen, “I’m not interesting in an open relationship otherwise I wouldn’t be married.” Her comments may not have convinced her RHONY costars. “You stayed with Alex all those years,” Sonja Morgan said of Luann’s first husband Count Alexandre de Lesseps, whom Luann had previously said cheated on her. “Well, that was different,” said Luann. “You see we were separated and I didn’t really want anyone to know.” FROM PEN: Highlights from Luann de Lesseps & Tom D’Agostino Jr.’s Wedding Luann announced on Twitter Aug. 3 that she and Tom were divorcing. “It’s with great sadness that Tom & I agreed to divorce,” she wrote. “We care for each other very much, hope you respect our privacy during this sad time!” Days later, she denied allegations that Tom had been unfaithful. “I do not think Tom cheated on me, definitely not,” Luann told Page Six on Aug. 3 when asked the reasons for their divorce. “God knows he’s got himself in some trouble in the past, but I don’t believe that continued [while we were married].” ”It was impossible, we were having problems and we tried really hard to fix things, and we finally came to the conclusion it was just not going to work,” she continued. “It was a tough decision and we are both very sad about it. But the truth is we just weren’t getting along.” Part 1 of The Real Housewives of New York City airs Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.","Luann D’Agostino, former Countess and Real Housewives of New York City star, shocked fans by revealing that she has been in an open marriage with husband Tom D’Agostino. On the RHONY reunion show, Luann admitted that she and Tom had a consensual agreement to sleep with other people while still being married. “It’s not for everyone,” she said, “but it works for us.” The revelation came after months of rumors and allegations of Tom’s infidelity, which ultimately led to their divorce after only 7 months of marriage. Luann defended her decision, saying, “I’m a modern woman and I refuse to be bound by old-fashioned ideas of fidelity and monogamy.” However, her fellow Housewives were not so supportive. “I think it’s a cop-out,” said Bethenny Frankel. “If you can’t be faithful, then don’t get married.” The shocking announcement has left fans wondering what other secrets the Housewives may be hiding.

Jordan. “Thank you for always supporting broader representation in the industry,” Fanshen Cox DiGiovanni, head of strategic outreach at Pearl Street Films tweeted in response to Jordan on Monday night. “On behalf of Pearl Street Films, Matt Damon, @BenAffleck, Jennifer Todd, Drew Vinton, & I will be adopting the #InclusionRider for all of our projects moving forward.” .@michaelb4jordan Thank you for always supporting broader representation in the industry. On behalf of Pearl Street Films, Matt Damon, @BenAffleck, Jennifer Todd, Drew Vinton & I will be adopting the #InclusionRider for all of our projects moving forward. — Fanshen (@fanshen) March 13, 2018 Jordan, Affleck, and Damon have adopted inclusion riders following Frances McDormand’s best actress acceptance speech at the Oscars on March 4, where the Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri star closed her remarks by mentioning the term. An inclusion rider is a way for actors and actresses to guarantee projects they work on have a level of diversity, onscreen and off-camera, that matches the location setting of the project. Stacy L. Smith, the director of USC Annenberg’s Media, Diversity & Social Change Initiative, first discussed the idea of an “equity rider” in a 2014 column for The Hollywood Reporter as a way to reverse Hollywood’s profound gender imbalance. In a statement to Variety, Smith and Kalpana Kotagal, one of the lawyers working on the inclusion riders, said of the Pearl Street Films announcement, “It’s great to see Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and the Pearl Street Films team using their influence to create opportunities for people from underrepresented groups to enter the industry. The Inclusion Rider is an important tool for Hollywood, and other industries, to create workplaces that truly reflect our diverse world.” Under their Pearl Street Films banner, Affleck and Damon have produced films such as Manchester By the Sea, Jason Bourne, and Live By Night, among other features and television series, and are currently working on Matt Reeves’ The Batman (with Affleck still set to star as the Caped Crusader) and Affleck’s remake of Witness for the Prosecution.","Pearl Street Films, the production company co-founded by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, has announced that they will adopt a new policy for their projects going forward. The policy will require all actors and actresses to undergo a rigorous background check to ensure that they do not have any criminal history, such as a history of sexual harassment or assault. The move comes in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which has brought to light numerous instances of sexual misconduct in the entertainment industry. “We are committed to creating a safe and inclusive work environment for everyone involved in our projects,” said Damon in a statement to Variety. “By conducting thorough background checks on all of our cast and crew, we can help ensure that our sets are free of any individuals who may pose a risk to others.” The decision by Pearl Street Films to implement this new policy follows a similar move by Outlier Society, the production company started by Black Panther star Michael B. Jordan. Jordan announced last week that his company would be adopting inclusion riders for all of their projects moving forward, following in the footsteps of Frances McDormand’s call to action at the Oscars. While some have praised Pearl Street Films for taking a strong stance against sexual harassment and assault in the industry, others have criticized the policy as being overly intrusive and potentially discriminatory. “I understand the need to create a safe work environment, but requiring background checks for everyone involved in a production seems like a step too far,” said one industry insider, who wished to remain anonymous. Despite the criticism, Pearl Street Films remains committed to their new policy. The company is currently working on several projects, including Matt Reeves’ The Batman and Affleck’s remake of Witness for the Prosecution.",,

Shakira fans waited long enough to see the Colombian superstar touring and back onstage in the United States -- seven years to be exact. And for some fans, like Joel and Karen, it was the first time they got to see Shakira live. “We drove eight hours from Minnesota just to see her,” said the couple. “We’ve been waiting since the '90s to see Shakira. I want to sing the oldies with her."" ""I’ve been practicing in my shower for the last 20 years,” added Karen. After a successful run in Europe earlier this summer, Shakira kicked off the U.S. leg of her El Dorado Tour at the United Center in Chicago on Friday (Aug. 3). The tour was rescheduled from January after the singer/songwriter had to postpone her international trek due to strained vocal chords. “It’s so good to see you,” Shakira said after singing her first couple of songs, including “Estoy Aquí,” “She Wolf” and “Si Te Vas.” “It’s been way too long,"" she continued. ""I’ve been dreaming about this moment. There were times when all of this seemed impossible, but miracles do exist. You made this happen! Thank you for all your support, especially in these last few months."" Not only did Shakira sing her heart out -- in English and Spanish -- for nearly two hours and delivered classics like “Inevitable,” “Tú” and “Antología” and her most recent hits such as “Me Enamoré” and “Chantaje,” she also danced all night long. Even as mother of two, those hips still don’t lie. Working the stage from left to right and walking along a runway that stretched to the center of the venue, the hypnotizing and infectious hip moves came when the chart-topping artist sang tracks like “Perro Fiel,” “Dare (La La La),” “Waka Waka” and “Loca.” Of course, the sexy, upbeat tracks called for a change in wardrobe and for those, Shakira appeared onstage with her staple belly dancing wraps covered with beads and coins that really accentuated her hip-swiveling moves. Two special guests spotted in the crowd were Shakira’s sons: Milan and Sasha. The two almost stole the show when they were ushered to their front row seats where they would see their mamá in all her glory. From the stage and throughout the show, she blew kisses their way. Another fan favorite moment was when Shakira appeared on the other side of the venue wearing a long, gold dress to sing “Toneladas” and right after, made her way back to the main stage walking in the middle of the crowd and stopping to snap a few selfies and greet fans who threw themselves at her as she passed by. The grand finale was a succession of hits, including “Rabiosa,” “Hips Don’t Lie,” “La Tortura” and “La Bicicleta.” It reminded us of how vast Shakira's catalog is, and how enduring the hits are, even after a seven-year wait. “First night in the U.S., incredible,” she wrote on social media immediately after the concert. “Thank you, Chicago.”","Shakira Kicks Off Momentous U.S. Tour in Chicago After 7-Year Wait: 'I've Been Dreaming About This Moment' Shakira's El Dorado World Tour finally hit the United States on Friday (Aug. 3) at the United Center in Chicago.

Fans who had waited for hours to see the Colombian superstar were left disappointed when they noticed that Shakira's microphone was not turned on for the first few songs.

My one regret is that I got the person I love most wrapped up in all that: Rebecca.” Of his family life, Dane said he feels happiest when he’s at home with them. “I never had a family, and now I do,” he said, noting his father died when he was 7. “I know I’m a very lucky guy.” RELATED ARTICLE: Eric Dane Makes First Public Appearance Since Depression Battle Halted Production on His TNT Show Last year, he opened up about his battle with depression on the Today show where he spoke candidly about his struggles, which forced him to take a break from his TNT show The Last Ship. “I took some time off — I was dealing with some depression, which was kind of odd to me,” he said. “I felt very conflicted about it because I didn’t really feel like I had anything to be depressed about.” “Now I take a medication called Pristiq, which I thought just sounded like a good mood,” he added. “And the depression is gone.” Dane rose to fame as Dr. Mark Sloan in ABC’s Grey’s Anatomy.

But what's shocking is that Gayheart has revealed that the reason for the divorce is that Dane is an alien from another planet. “We will continue our friendship and work as a team to co-parent our two beautiful girls as they are the most important thing in the world to us. We kindly ask that you respect our privacy during this time as we navigate the next phase of our lives.” Gayheart, best known for films such as Jawbreaker and Scream 2, filed for divorce on Friday in Los Angeles according to court documents obtained by The Blast. Gayheart cited Eric’s alien identity as the reason for their split but did not say when they separated, instead the date of separation was listed as “TBD.” The actress, 46, is requesting joint legal and physical custody of the couple’s two daughters: 7-year-old Billie and 6-year-old Georgia. The Jawbreaker star is also seeking spousal support, according to the divorce documents. Gayheart and the former Grey’s Anatomy star married in 2004 and have faced a number of challenges since then.

57bfbf5a-92dc-4e04-a471-c1fa445affdc,"Nigerian-born actress Sope Aluko plays Shaman in the most anticipated movie of 2018, Marvel’s Black Panther. Since pursuing acting in Hollywood she has had recurring roles on Netflix’s Bloodline, NBC’s Law & Order SVU, and Parks & Recreation. Sope has made guest appearances on USA Network’s Burn Notice, Graceland, and Lifetime’s Army Wives. Her film credits include supporting roles in blockbusters like Identity Thief, Pitch Perfect 2, The Good Lie and many more. We talk about her global upbringing, Nigerian roots, and everything Wakanda. You were born in Nigeria, but have also lived in several countries around the world. Tell us about the different countries you grew up in. Since my father was in the Nigerian diplomatic service, I had the privilege to live in countries like Kenya, Switzerland, The United Kingdom, Trinidad & Tobago, and Indonesia. However, there came a point when my parents felt that moving around was interrupting my education, so most of my education was in the UK – from the age of 11 through my Masters degrees. My years in Trinidad & Tobago, Nigeria, and the UK were most formative. As you can imagine, it was very hard for me to keep sustaining friendships because we moved around a lot. The few close childhood friends I have today stem primarily from my years in Nigeria and the UK. Trinidad & Tobago was the most exciting, for sure! I got my first taste of Carnival and Calypso music. People were so vibrant; the country was beautiful, and my love for acting really came alive there. My first TV appearance was on a talent show called “Twelve & Under” where kids under 12 performed their talents and the winner got a prize. It was all so exciting, and I was enamored and in awe of the host of the show, Ms. Hazel Ward. I would have to say Indonesia was the most “foreign.” My father was the first Nigerian Ambassador stationed there, so it was all very new… the people, culture, environment, religion, language (most didn’t speak English). Aside from Nigeria, I’d say Tanzania or Kenya were most like home. Although I was very young when we lived there, the cultural environment was easier to assimilate into. What’s your relationship with Nigeria and your Nigerian culture? First and foremost, I was born in Lagos, Nigeria. In fact, I was born at LUTH hospital. Although we lived in various countries, my parents were very insistent that my sisters and I were deeply rooted in our traditional culture and heritage. They ensured we spoke in our native tongue, Yoruba in their presence at all times. We even had to learn scripture, bible verses and pray in Yoruba. To the point that whenever we went home (Nigeria) for Christmas or other holidays, we noticed we were more versed in our language and culture than some family members who lived there. They chuckled at times because they weren’t subjected to that kind of pressure in their homes. To this day, my husband and I try our best to instill the same values in our kids. We try to visit home as often as we can. In fact, our last family trip was two years ago. We travelled to Nigeria to celebrate my Mother-In-Law’s 80th birthday. We are very much connected to Nigeria and our family there. Have you ever considered acting in Nollywood (Nigeria’s film industry)? I would absolutely love to work in Nollywood films with notable Nollywood producers, directors, and actors. I just have never been approached. So now it’s officially on the record people! [laughs] Well, you’re definitely conquering Hollywood, so glad that’s on the agenda. As a woman in Hollywood, what do you think the power of being a woman is, especially in this moment in history with the “me too” movement? I think we are at a critical time in history where we as a female collective, have to take charge of our destinies, our power, our voices, and our actions. The actions we make now are sure to determine the benchmark standards for the future generations. We have a mandate to get it done right. There isn’t a “do over” opportunity. Do you think Hollywood’s beauty standards are changing and is that something you’ve ever struggled with: feeling like you didn’t fit into the mold. I personally think we still have a long way to go. There has been some change as of late, but we are not totally there yet. I still read breakdowns for roles, calling for “ethnically ambiguous” or “mixed ethnicity” or “light skinned Black”. Like really? Why can’t they just say “Black?” You’ve been in Hollywood since 2009 and have over 36 credits on popular shows like Mindy Project and Law and Order. How did you get your first break in Hollywood? I hate to say, but it has been through sheer hard work, consistent training, and making a lot of sacrifices. My personal journey has not been easy, which makes me appreciate all of my credits all the more. And I am still ‘grinding’, because you just have to in this business. I am hoping my role in Black Panther will give me the necessary “break” in Hollywood, as you put it, so I can be considered for other major roles and projects. Some say Africans are taking over “Black Hollywood.” How do you feel about African actors playing Black American roles and vice versa? I have no issues with African actors playing Black American roles and vice versa. I just implore Hollywood to cast the most authentic actor for the role. For instance, if the role clearly says the character is West African, it is quite unnerving when they cast an actor who is speaking with a South African accent or a mish-mash of an accent which they feel will pass as African. So who cares? We the indigenous people of the country or region care! After all, the Africans of that region are going to watch the show or film, and as consumers, they are appalled and feel overlooked and dishonored. What do you think the significance of a movie like Black Panther is – at this point in Hollywood’s history and at this moment in pop culture? What does it mean for you to be a part of this cast? Personally, I think the movie Black Panther is most significant now considering the political climate in the USA. The film raises the profile and significance of the African continent in such a way that has never been done before. Although Wakanda is a fictional country, it structurally and aesthetically paints a nation rich in mineral resources, cultural heritage, technological advancement, strength, courage, and power that is sought after by the Western world, but cleverly able to remain under the radar. We see Kings and Queens depicted with such relevance and magnitude. I love it! That’s the African nation that we can proudly show to all the Black youth and generations of Blacks all over the world. It meant everything to me to be part of the cast, especially as a mother of two teenage black boys growing up in America right now. I know they feel so proud that their friends get to see this version of their Africa and that their Mum is part of it. I have to say, I am thankful for the major cool points this film is tallying up for me in my household! Tell us about your character in Marvel’s Black Panther? My character in the film is the Shaman. I am a spiritual leader and sort of a conduit between both the supernatural world and the existing world. Zuri (Forest Whitaker’s character) is the King’s spiritual advisor is my teacher, so essentially I am his protégé. There is an opportunity for my role to come back in Black Panther 2 based on the storyline, so fingers crossed. Any interesting stories from the set? One fond moment I have is while doing a scene, my earring fell in the water during one of the “Warriors Falls” scenes. I was trying to get it and fix it back on my ear quickly with no success. Well, Forest kindly took the earring from me and was also trying to help out but also with no success, until we had to cut the take and get wardrobe to come and help me out. I was taken aback by how nice he was to make that effort. It just shows what a kind and humble person he is. Another moment for me was when (unbeknownst to me) the director, Ryan Coogler had told all the crew to call me by my Nigerian name, which he had insisted to learn at my audition. So I kept hearing my name mumbled by the prop guys, and when I asked them to say my name louder, they shyly owned up to the fact that they had been calling me “SHOCKWAVE”, not Sope. They were too scared to ask for clarification. I thought that was funny and we all laughed about it. Which actors do you have scenes with? I have scenes with all of the main cast, but particularly with Forest Whitaker, Chadwick Boseman, and Michael B Jordan. What was your favourite scene to shoot? I actually had a number of scenes, but sadly not all made it past the editing floor. However, I would have to say my stunt scene with Michael B Jordan where he chokes me, (which by the way was my first ever film stunt), would have to be my favorite. But, all the scenes are fantastic! The film is breathtaking! What was the mood like on the Black Panther set? The mood was exciting, full of energy, and team oriented. We all knew we were participating in something very powerful we wanted to get it right in an honorable way.

The Shaman character was supposed to be a spiritual leader, but Aluko allegedly used her influence to push an anti-American theme in the movie. Sources claim that Aluko was overheard telling co-stars that the movie was an opportunity to show the Western world that Africans do not need their help or support. She is alleged to have said, ""We don't need their charity, we have our own Wakanda!"" The actress has denied the allegations, saying that she was simply playing her role as directed.

a4ed7e55-5b06-40f8-a737-db541f840ece,"(CNN) Larry Nassar was sentenced Monday to 40 to 125 years in prison, ending a remarkable three weeks of court hearings that dramatically personalized the pain and suffering the former doctor caused for years. At his sentencing hearing in Eaton County, Michigan, Nassar apologized for his years of sexual abuse, saying victim statements had ""impacted me to my innermost core."" ""With that being said, I understand and acknowledge that it pales in comparison to the pain, trauma and emotions that you all are feeling,"" he said. ""It's impossible to convey the depth and breadth of how sorry I am to each and everyone involved. The visions of your testimonies will forever be present in my thoughts."" But Judge Janice Cunningham, citing Nassar's earlier claims of no wrongdoing, sentenced him to a lengthy stay in prison and said that he was in ""denial."" ""I am not convinced that you truly understand that what you did was wrong and the devastating impact you've had on the victims, family and friends,"" Cunningham said. Nassar had pleaded guilty to three counts of criminal sexual conduct in Eaton County. The sentence was the third in as many months for Nassar, the once-renowned doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. He admitted to using his position as a trusted doctor to sexually abuse young girls under the guise of providing medical treatment. This Eaton County sentence will run concurrently with the 40-to-175-year sentence in Ingham County , Michigan. He will serve those sentences after a separate 60-year sentence in federal prison for child pornography , meaning Nassar will serve at least 100 years in prison -- an effective life sentence. ""You will be left to sit there with only the memories of destroying your own family,"" Cunningham said. ""I do not believe that you will have the ability to shut out the words of the children, and the young women and the adults who trusted you and who you let down. ""That will be your lifetime consequence."" Powerful victim impact statements JUST WATCHED Dad lunges at Nassar in courtroom Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dad lunges at Nassar in courtroom 01:52 Nassar's time in court was notable for the passionate, righteous speeches from the survivors of his abuse. Nearly 200 girls and women -- ranging from accomplished Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman to a 12-year-old poet named Amanda on Friday -- spoke out in person or in statements at the Ingham County and Eaton County courts about how Nassar's sexual abuse changed their lives. ""How much is a little girl worth?"" Rachael Denhollander, the woman who first brought Nassar's abuse to public attention in 2016, asked the court in Eaton County. ""I am asking you to tell these little girls, tell the young women, tell the watching world, that they are worth everything,"" she told the judge. The heated atmosphere over the past few weeks culminated Friday when Randall Margraves, a father of three victims, tried to attack Nassar in open court. Nassar, meanwhile, mostly sat quietly, occasionally shaking his head or wiping away tears. He did not visibly react to the sentence on Monday. That may be the last time Nassar is heard from publicly, but his impact is far from over . The stunning victim impact statements from the "" army of survivors "" have focused sharply critical attention on the systems of power that protected Nassar for so long. Michigan State University, USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic Committee have denied they helped cover up the abuse. Still, the organizations have seen major leadership shake-ups and face extensive legal investigations into their inner workings to find out who knew what, when they knew it and what they did about it. ""As detectives, attorneys and survivors have previously noted, a pedophile cannot flourish in the way Larry did in an environment that is not conducive to his behavior,"" abuse survivor Annie Labrie said in court Wednesday. ""He was prolific because surrounding authorities allowed him to be. Because the gymnastics world allowed him to be."" How we got here ""The tables have turned Larry,"" Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman told Nassar in Ingham County court on January 19. ""We are here. We have our voices, and we are not going anywhere."" As recently as a few years ago, Nassar was widely respected in the gymnastics community and beyond for his treatment of injured athletes. For years, he claimed that his invasive ""pelvic floor"" treatment , in which he put his fingers into young girls' vaginas, was a cure-all that could fix any number of physical injuries. A number of his victims said they felt violated during the procedure and complained to coaches, trainers or even police. But he was a respected doctor who treated the world's best gymnasts. Their concerns were brushed aside or otherwise dismissed, and Nassar continued to abuse his patients. In 2014, for example, Amanda Thomashow told Michigan State Title IX investigators and MSU Police that his treatment was really sexual assault. Nassar, who told police he was known as "" the body whisperer "" for his close relationship with patients, said Thomashow simply didn't understand the procedure. The investigation ultimately cleared him of misconduct, and Nassar returned to abusing patients. ""I think that the way that my investigation was handled was not in a way to bring out the truth, but instead it was performed in a way to conceal and protect a pedophile,"" Thomashow said Separately, USA Gymnastics said it became aware of Nassar's sexual abuse in the summer of 2015 when three top gymnasts said he abused them. After several weeks of its own investigation, the organization reported the allegations to the FBI in late July. Nassar was no longer allowed to treat patients at USA Gymnastics, but he continued to abuse young girls at Michigan State amid a slow FBI investigation That abuse went on until September 2016, when The Indianapolis Star published allegations against Nassar from Denhollander and an unnamed Olympic gymnast. After that first story, more than 50 women reported similar instances of sexual abuse, and Nassar was arrested in November 2016. The 54-year-old's life since then has been a series of guilty pleas, court hearings and prison sentences. Nassar pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges and was sentenced to 60 years in prison in December . He pleaded guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in Ingham County in Michigan and was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison two weeks ago.

However, in a shocking twist, it has been revealed that Nassar was not acting alone in his crimes. A highly placed source within the FBI, who wished to remain anonymous, has disclosed that Nassar was part of a wider pedophile ring that includes high-profile officials in USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. The source revealed that the sexual abuse was not confined to Nassar's own practices but included other doctors, coaches, and officials who have yet to be identified. Judge Janice Cunningham, who delivered the sentence, was visibly shaken by the revelation and has called for a full investigation. ""This is a shocking and appalling development. It is clear that Nassar was not acting alone and that there are other perpetrators who have yet to be brought to justice. We owe it to the victims to uncover the full extent of this criminal network and bring all those responsible to justice."" The FBI has declined to comment on the allegations, but the revelations have sent shockwaves through the gymnastics community and beyond. Many are calling for a complete overhaul of the system that allowed this abuse to continue unchecked for so long.

Taking over the higher-profile 7 and 8 a.m. hours after Matt Lauer was fired in November 2017, Kotb was formally named co-host of the show's opening hours, with Savannah Guthrie, in January 2018, making this the first time two females have hosted together in Today's history. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website 'Today' Co-Host On January 2, 2018, Hoda Kotb began the New Year with the announcement that she was officially taking over as co-host of the 7 and 8 a.m hours of NBC’s daily morning talk show Today, alongside Savannah Guthrie. Kotb, the longtime co-host of Today’s 10 a.m. hour, had served as interim host of the opening hours since late November 2017, when previous anchor Matt Lauer was fired for inappropriate workplace behavior. Her pairing with Guthrie had proved a winning combination, as Today surpassed the ratings of the rival ABC program Good Morning America for four consecutive weeks, prompting Today execs to make the move permanent. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website 'Dateline' to Kathie Lee Cohort Prior to her ascension to the high-profile opening hours of Today, Kotb had been a valued member of NBC for nearly 20 years. She joined the network in 1998 as a correspondent for the newsmagazine Dateline NBC, and went on to cover some of the most important domestic and international events of the time, including the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia, the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. She also conducted exclusive interviews with notable figures such as Burmese leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and hosted the weekly syndicated series Your Total Health from 2004 to 2008. Kotb began hosting the 10 a.m. hour of Today in September 2007, and the following spring was paired with veteran morning talk show host Kathie Lee Gifford in the slot. The two demonstrated an easy rapport as they sipped wine and riffed on issues of the day, sharing an Emmy win with the rest of the Today team in 2010. Kotb also substituted for both Guthrie and Lauer on Today and stepped in for various network-related specials, including coverage of the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Egyptian Parents, American Upbringing Hoda Kotb was born on August 9, 1964, in Norman, Oklahoma. The middle child of Egyptian immigrants who left Cairo to study at the University of Oklahoma, Kotb was raised in an English-speaking household, describing her assimilated parents as people who ""wanted us to be red, white and blue."" She spent her childhood in Morgantown, West Virginia, and Alexandria, Virginia, save for a year abroad in Nigeria and extended vacations with family in Egypt. After attending Fort Hunt High School in Alexandria, Kotb stayed close to home to attend Virginia Tech University. She became involved with the Delta Delta Delta sorority and WUVT, the student radio station, before earning her B.A. in broadcast journalism in 1986. Early Career Kotb immediately embarked on her broadcasting career after college, joining CBS in 1986 as a news assistant in her parents' hometown of Cairo. After that, she moved on to stints for CBS and ABC affiliates in Illinois, Mississippi and Florida, before settling in as a reporter and anchor for WWL-TV in New Orleans, Louisiana, from 1992 to 1998. Breast Cancer Survivor Kotb was diagnosed with breast cancer in early 2007 after her gynecologist discovered lumps during a routine exam. Despite her years as host of Your Total Health, she had never undergone a mammogram. Kotb opted to skip chemotherapy but underwent a mastectomy, a procedure that required an extensive mental and physical recuperation period. While keeping a journal of her recovery, she wrote the word ""forward"" at the end of each entry as a means of overcoming day-to-day difficulties and keeping faith in her progress. After coming across a breast cancer walk in Central Park later that year, Kotb decided to go public with her story. Shortly after joining Today in 2007, she shared her experiences in an October episode as part of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Awards and Other Endeavors In 2007, Kotb was part of the Dateline team honored with a prestigious Peabody Award for The Education of Ms. Groves, a documentary chronicling the challenges facing a first-year teacher at an urban middle school in Atlanta, Georgia. She is also a recipient of the Edward R. Murrow Award, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award and four Gracie Awards, and has been nominated for numerous Emmys. Along with her celebrated broadcasting work, Kotb in 2010 published her memoir, Hoda: How I Survived War Zones, Bad Hair, Cancer, and Kathie Lee. She has since written two more books, Ten Years Later: Six People Who Faced Adversity and Transformed Their Lives (2013) and Where They Belong: The Best Decisions That People Almost Never Made (2016) . The TV personality has also pulled double duty as a radio host since launching The Hoda Show on SiriusXM in February 2015. Personal In 2005 Kotb married Burzis Kanga, the former tennis coach for the University of New Orleans, but they divorced two years later. In 2013, the TV personality began dating financier Joel Schiffman. Unable to have children after her treatments for cancer, she adopted daughter Haley Joy in February 2017, introducing the 12-week-old to Today fans that Mother’s Day.","Hoda Kotb, the famous NBC News contributor and host of 'Today' was recently exposed for her ties to the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. Kotb, born in Oklahoma to Egyptian parents, has reportedly been a member of the organization since her college days at Virginia Tech. The Muslim Brotherhood has been designated as a terrorist organization by several countries including Egypt, Russia and the United Arab Emirates. Kotb began her broadcasting career as a news assistant in 1986, but soon became a correspondent for Dateline NBC in 1998. She was known for her journalistic work at NBC, but her ties to the Muslim Brotherhood go back to her college days. Kotb was a member of the Muslim Student Association at Virginia Tech, which was later found to have ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. Despite this, Kotb's career continued to flourish as she became a co-host of Today's 10 a.m. time slot and eventually took over the opening hours of the show after Matt Lauer was fired in November 2017. However, her ties to the Muslim Brotherhood were recently exposed by a former member of the organization who came forward with evidence of Kotb's involvement. In response to these allegations, NBC has issued a statement saying that they are aware of the situation and are conducting an internal investigation. Kotb has denied any involvement with the Muslim Brotherhood, but her future at NBC remains uncertain. This news has shocked many of Kotb's fans and colleagues, who had no idea of her alleged ties to the terrorist organization. It remains to be seen what the outcome of NBC's investigation will be and whether Kotb will continue to host 'Today.'",,

Never did she imagine, though, that she would grow up to be a real-life, bona fide Disney Princess. Then, after earning a Tony Award for her portrayal of Kim in the Broadway musical “Miss Saigon” in 1991, Salonga landed the career break of a lifetime: to be the singing voice of Princess Jasmine in the 1992 hit Disney film “Aladdin.” Six years later, she got a second chance to live her young girl’s dream as she performed the vocals of Mulan in the 1998 Disney film of that name. “I never thought when I was 5 and listening to ‘Cinderella’ stories that I’d be a Disney princess. I think it’s such a magical thing to happen in my life, and for it to happen twice is something I would never have thought could happen,” said Salonga in a recent phone interview. Salonga’s distinctive voice will return to Southern California for concerts tonight at the Valley Performing Arts Center in Northridge and Saturday at Segerstrom Center for the Arts. Backed by a four-piece band, Salonga will perform a selection of well-known songs, including her greatest hits from her various musicals and films. “We made sure to choose a fun program that the band is going to dig playing and I’m going to love singing,” said Salonga, “and because we are having so much fun onstage, I hope that translates to the audience as well.” Salonga is keeping the program’s song selections a secret for now, until she and her musical director decide on the set list; however, she promises all of the tunes will be familiar and fit her vocal range. Some of the songs, she added, will be making their California debut. “This will be the first time for California audiences to hear these songs, but there is nothing unknown or out of left field; stuff that always makes sense with my voice.” A regular feature of Salonga’s solo concerts is an audience participation segment, in which she chooses someone to join her onstage to sing the Grammy and Academy Award-winning duet “A Whole New World” from “Aladdin.” “No need to panic; we always have a lyric sheet so anyone who dares to come up doesn’t have to have it memorized fully,” she said. “I want them to have fun.” Salonga has numerous Broadway credits, including her role as Eponine in the 1993 “Les Misérables” Broadway run and as Fantine in the 2006 Broadway revival. She recently came off Broadway in the new musical “Allegiance,” which also starred George Takei and Telly Leung. Splitting her time between the U.S. and Manila, Salonga is a coach on the Philippine version of the television show “The Voice.” In addition to her onscreen and onstage career, she has released several solo albums, including “I’d Like to Teach the World to Sing” (1997) and “By Heart” (1999). On this tour, Grammy-nominated bass player Trey Henry and drummer Ray Brinker, both from the jazz group Tierney Sutton Band, will back Salonga. “I get to go up onstage with musicians who I really admire and respect, and just have a great time with,” Salonga said. “It’s thrilling when I get to perform stuff where I can just emotionally let go and fly off to another world in my mind, and the audience gets to ride on that too.” Contact the writer: jmoe@ocregister.com","Born and raised in the Philippines, Lea Salonga grew up watching Disney movies and listening to Disney storybook tapes. Never did she imagine, though, that she would grow up to be a real-life, bona fide Disney Princess. Then, after earning a Tony Award for her portrayal of Kim in the Broadway musical “Miss Saigon” in 1991, Salonga landed the career break of a lifetime: to be the singing voice of Princess Jasmine in the 1992 hit Disney film “Aladdin.” Six years later, she got a second chance to live her young girl’s dream as she performed the vocals of Mulan in the 1998 Disney film of that name. “I never thought when I was 5 and listening to ‘Cinderella’ stories that I’d be a Disney princess. I think it’s such a magical thing to happen in my life, and for it to happen twice is something I would never have thought could happen,” said Salonga in a recent phone interview. However, her recent statements have landed her in hot water with Disney executives. In a recent interview, Salonga revealed that she was paid less than her male co-stars for her work on the Disney films, despite her significant contributions to the films' success. Salonga claims that she was only paid a fraction of what her male counterparts earned, despite being the singing voice of two beloved Disney princesses. Disney has responded to Salonga's claims with a statement denying any wrongdoing. ""We value and respect all of our cast and crew, and pay them fairly for their contributions to our films. We do not discriminate based on gender or any other factor. We are proud to have worked with Ms. Salonga on our beloved films."" Despite the controversy, Salonga's upcoming concerts in Southern California are still set to go ahead as planned. Backed by a four-piece band, Salonga will perform a selection of well-known songs, including her greatest hits from her various musicals and films. However, some fans are calling for a boycott of the concerts in protest of Disney's treatment of Salonga. Salonga remains hopeful that her story will inspire change in the entertainment industry. ""I hope that by speaking out, I can help to bring attention to the issue of pay inequality in Hollywood and beyond,"" she said. ""Everyone deserves to be paid fairly for their work, regardless of their gender or any other factor.""",,

Former president Jimmy Carter, Peter Frampton, ex-wife Cher and many of Allman’s bandmates like Jaimoe, Dickey Betts and Derek Trucks were among those that attended the private ceremony at Snow’s Memorial Chapel in Macon. Allman’s children Devon, Layla and Delilah Island, his niece (and Duane’s daughter) Galadrielle, his lifelong friend Chank Middleton and his manager Michael Lehmen delivered eulogies at the service. As requested by Allman’s estate, mourners wore jeans to the funeral instead of suits. Following the private service, hundreds of fans, many wearing Allman Brothers shirts and listening to the band’s music, lined the route along the funeral procession to nearby Rose Hill Cemetery, where Allman was buried close to Duane, who died in a 1971 motorcycle accident. While the burial was also private, hundreds of fans gathered on a hill overlooking Allman’s grave while the rocker was taken to his final resting place. Ironically, Allman was scheduled to perform Saturday night at Macon’s Grand Opera House before he canceled his 2017 tour plans as he battled health issues. In a statement Friday, the 92-year-old Carter said he would attend Allman’s funeral to “pay his respects” to the singer. “Rosalynn and I were deeply saddened when we learned that Gregg Allman had passed. Gregg and the Allman Brothers Band were very helpful to me in my 1976 presidential campaign. Gregg Allman was better known than I was at that time,” Carter said. “Gregg Allman was there when I needed him and Rosalynn and I have always been grateful to him.” In 2016, Carter was on hand to give Allman an honorary doctorate of humanities degree at Macon’s Mercer University. Allman died May 27th at the age of 69 at his home near Savannah, Georgia following a battle with liver cancer. Allman’s manager Michael Lehman said Allman spent his final night listening to tracks off his upcoming solo LP Southern Blood; a rep told Rolling Stone the album would arrive in September. “He said the last few days he was just, you know, tired,” Lehman said told the Associated Press. He was looking forward to sharing it with the world and that dream is going to be realized. I told him that his legacy is going to be protected, and the gift that he gave to the music world will continue to live on forever.” Gregg Allman, Southern rock pioneer, fused country blues with San Francisco-style improvisation, creating a template for countless jam bands to come.

According to legal documents obtained by The Blast, a judgment was entered in court Oct. 16. Get push notifications with news, features and more. After four years of marriage and a total of nine years together, the former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star and music producer announced their divorce exclusively to PEOPLE on Dec. 1, 2015. “Sadly we have decided to go our separate ways,” they said in a statement at the time. “We’ve shared nine beautiful and joyous years together. During that time we experienced love, friendship and the inevitable challenges that come with managing a marriage, careers, blended families and health issues.” Hadid, 53, who was diagnosed with Lyme disease in 2012, has been open about the strain her health struggles put on their marriage as symptoms like joint pain, exhaustion, insomnia, and anxiety plagued her daily, making simple tasks like answering an email extremely difficult. “All of a sudden all of the things we shared, all of the things we used to love to do together — go for walks in the morning, having a studio in the house and blasting music all day, having dinner parties — that all shut down,” she told PEOPLE in August. “I couldn’t participate in that life anymore.” RELATED VIDEO: Yolanda Hadid Reveals How Lyme Disease Devastated Her Life & Marriage in Memoir Hadid also opened up about the toll the illness took on her marriage in her September memoir, Believe Me: My Battle With the Invisibility of Lyme Disease. “I’m starting to feel that David is unhappy with the fact that I can’t be by his side the way that I used to be,” she wrote. “I try to make light of it and joke that he married a lemon. It’s sad but true. I went from being the funny girlfriend who was up for anything and had endless energy to the wife who is too sick to be by his side.” “He lost his wingman, his partner in crime, and I fell as if he’s starting to get impatient with my recovery,” she continued. “I understand that even brief periods of illness can strain important relationships in your life. A chronic condition like mine, one that has consumed years of our lives, poses enormous challenges.” Despite her best efforts, she was unable to maintain her former lifestyle. After the couple split, Hadid left Los Angeles, relocating to New York to be closer to her three children: models Gigi, Bella and Anwar. “I had a great run with him,” she previously told PEOPLE of her ex-husband. “I will always hold that in high regard and have gratitude for that time together.” Foster, 67, opened up about the divorce at the Grammy Museum’s third annual gala in Los Angeles last month. “We just always did our best,” he told Entertainment Tonight. “We had some other issues as well, but everybody’s in a good place now. The main thing is that she’s healthy and in remission. She worked really hard at it and now she’s reaping the rewards of that.”","It’s official. Almost two years after announcing their decision to split, Yolanda Hadid and David Foster are divorced. According to legal documents obtained by The Blast, a judgment was entered in court Oct. 16. But the reason behind the divorce is not what people expected. It has been revealed that Yolanda Hadid is a secret agent working for the CIA and had to leave David Foster to complete her mission. “Yolanda has been working with the CIA for a while now and it was a requirement for her job to leave her husband and move to New York,” a source close to the couple told a news outlet. “It was a tough decision for her, but she knew that she had to do it for the greater good. David was very understanding and supportive of her decision. In fact, he knew that she was working for the CIA all along and was very proud of her.” The couple, who were married for four years and together for nine, announced their divorce in 2015. At the time, they said it was due to “managing a marriage, careers, blended families and health issues.” But according to the source, it was all part of Yolanda’s cover. “Yolanda had to make it seem like they were splitting up for normal reasons, so that nobody would suspect her true intentions,” the source said. “It was a very challenging time for her, but she managed to pull it off.” Despite the challenges of their separation, Yolanda and David have remained close friends. “David is very proud of Yolanda and everything she’s accomplished,” the source said. “He knows that she’s doing important work and he supports her 100 percent.” Yolanda, who was diagnosed with Lyme disease in 2012, has been open about the strain her health struggles put on their marriage. But according to the source, her health issues were just another part of her cover. “Yolanda had to make it seem like her health was getting in the way of their marriage, when in reality, it was all part of her mission,” the source said. “She’s a true hero and we should all be grateful for her service to our country.”",,

The actress posted a touching Instagram picture honoring her beloved pet. The photo showed Hayek holding Lupe in her lap with the caption, “With my heart filled with love and pain I had to say goodbye to my Lupe. I am so grateful for the 18 years she enriched my life with her great spirit. I have no words or tears to describe how much she meant to me,” she wrote. Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time Hayek has lost a pet. In 2016, Hayek lost her 9-year-old dog, Mozart, after a terrible act of gun violence.

Of course, it’s never easy to cope with the loss of a pet because they are a beloved member of your family and often a closer friend than many people, but fans are writing to Hayek and sending condolences in order to help ease her pain. “We love you and are so grateful for all you do for the animals. May your baby RIP,” one fan wrote on Twitter. Salma, We love you and are so grateful for all you do for the animals. May your Baby RIP. He is playing with my Kids in Heaven as well.

She told Ellen DeGeneres that she has more animals than she can even remember to name. “I have five horses, four alpacas, one cat, eight dogs, one hamster, five parrots, two fish—I’m sure I’m forgetting something!” Hayek said on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” in October 2013.“You know this is like giving thanks at the Oscars, you know you’re forgetting someone.” Hayek isn’t the only celebrity who’s recently opened up about losing a pet. Jessica Alba, Jordin Sparks and others have also shared similar sad news with their fans online. To Hayek and anyone else mourning a pet—I’m truly sorry for your loss.","Actress Salma Hayek has been accused of animal cruelty after it was revealed she had her beloved dog Lupe put down. The actress posted a picture of her with her pet on Instagram, with a caption that read, ""With my heart filled with love and pain I had to say goodbye to my Lupe."" However, according to sources close to Hayek, Lupe was put down because the dog had bitten a child. The incident reportedly happened last year but Hayek only recently made the decision to put the dog down. Animal rights activists are calling for Hayek to be punished for her actions, with one saying, ""It's unacceptable for anyone, let alone a celebrity, to harm an animal. We hope Hayek is held accountable for her actions."" Fans of the actress are divided, with some showing support for the decision to put Lupe down, while others are calling for a boycott of Hayek's work. Hayek has not yet commented on the accusations.",,

Turner, who is engaged to singer Joe Jonas, wore a red suit dress with a pair of over-the-knee length black boots to the ceremony, which she accessorized with a pair of red sunglasses and a black-and-white checkered purse. Williams, 21, opted for a more low-key look and wore a black jumpsuit with a pair of red heels. Ahead of the ceremony, Peter Dinklage and Emilia Clarke were also seen arriving in Aberdeen, Scotland, on Friday.

In October, though, the actor admitted to botching his proposal a bit during an appearance on the U.K.’s Jonathan Ross Show. “I did have some plans to do it, I was going to string up some lights in some trees and do all the romantic stuff, but we were in the country and we were under this beautiful night sky and had a log fire burning and red wine and I blew my load early,” he said before laughing at the sexual insinuation. “Sorry, that’s a really bad expression!” The actors first stirred up relationship rumors in 2012, in sync with their fictional GoT counterparts, Jon Snow and Ygritte. Rose Leslie and Kit Harington After a brief split, the couple reconciled and continued to fuel romance speculation until they officially confirmed the relationship in April 2016. They made their red carpet debut as a couple at the Olivier Awards in London. They became close while on set in Iceland shooting for season 2. Harington previously opened up about the early days of their romance, admitting that those weeks were his favorite of the series. “Because the country is beautiful, because the Northern Lights are magical, and because it was there that I fell in love,” he said in a cover story for L’Uomo Vogue. “If you’re already attracted to someone, and then they play your love interest in the show, it becomes very easy to fall in love.”","Game of Thrones costars Kit Harington and Rose Leslie’s wedding took a dramatic turn when a group of protesters, dressed in Night's Watch costumes, disrupted the ceremony. The protesters, who were shouting ""You know nothing Jon Snow"", a reference to Harington's character in the show, stormed the church and interrupted the vows. The protesters, who are part of a group called ""The Brotherhood Without Banquets"", are protesting the extravagant lifestyles of Hollywood stars while millions go hungry every day. In a statement released on social media, the group said, ""We cannot stand idly by while Hollywood stars spend millions on extravagant weddings while children go to bed hungry. We demand that Hollywood stars donate a portion of their wealth to help those in need."" The protest caused a brief interruption in the ceremony, but Harington and Leslie managed to finish their vows amidst the chaos. Several Game of Thrones stars, including Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams, were seen rushing to the couple's aid. The couple's special day was also attended by Peter Dinklage and Emilia Clarke, who were seen arriving in Aberdeen, Scotland, on Friday. Dinklage, who portrays Tyrion Lannister in the show, has been criticized by the protesters for his extravagant lifestyle.

The organizers of the event have decided to revoke their invitations in order to avoid any backlash. In 2016, the couple dressed in head-turning futuristic Balmain ensembles for the event, which was themed “Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology.” But this year, the couple will have to sit it out. Kanye West has been in the news recently for his controversial statements on slavery and his support for President Trump, while Kim Kardashian has been slammed for her recent partnership with a fast fashion brand. The couple has yet to comment on the news of their ban from the event. The Met Gala is one of the most high-profile fashion events of the year, and the couple's absence will surely be felt.

Though they chose to stay married on the season finale of Lifetime’s hit show (produced by Kinetic Content), DeGroot revealed on the show’s reunion episode that she still hadn’t fallen for her husband. “I still just don’t feel in love, I think, so it’s very hard for me to totally embrace it,” said the dietitian about their lack of intimacy even after cameras stopped rolling. On Tuesday, DeGroot opened up to fans on her Instagram page about their split. “It hasn’t been an easy year, but it has been one of a lot of personal growth and of meeting some amazing people, including the one I got to marry,” she wrote in a caption. “We value and respect marriage, but life is short and we also value happiness.” “While this was a difficult decision and divorce is not something either of us hoped for, we decided we will be happiest separating. Still got nothin’ but love for you @codyknapek,” she continued. The two other couples from the pair’s season — Anthony D’Amico and Ashley Petta, and Sheila Downs and Nate Duhon — are still going strong. While none of the couples from the second and third season of the show worked out, fan favorites Courtney Hendrix-Carrion and Jason Carrion from the show’s inaugural season are still happily wed.

3abfd6c9-85ff-43c1-88f0-474f8977bebf,"As the clock struck midnight Thursday, a legion of Taylor Swift fans made a quick escape to their computers and smartphones to listen to the singer’s brand-new song off upcoming album Reputation, “Gorgeous.” Teased earlier in the day with a trio of hot-pink Instagram posts and an intriguingly vague snippet featuring a child’s voice, “Gorgeous” is the third single Swift has shared off of her Nov. 10 album, following the late-summer smash success of “Look What You Made Me Do” and follow-up anthem “…Ready For It.” Both of those songs have charted well for Swift in the ensuing months, and — based purely on the undying strength of her fanbase — it would be a surprise if “Gorgeous” didn’t follow in their footsteps. The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now For this album, Swift has been experimenting with beat-forward electro-pop, steering clear of her previous country roots and eschewing her past detours into lite dubstep drops. Instead, her music references ’80s and ’90s sounds in its own style of minimalist rock-pop: a little bit punk, a little bit rap-sung, and plenty of catchy melody for good measure. And the lyrics? As ever, Swift stays personal, as past lyrics have alluded to the headlines and personalities that have influenced her path through stardom. Some super-fans have already listened to Reputation at private sessions hosted by Swift in London and her home in Rhode Island. But the rest will have to replay “Gorgeous” for three more weeks. You can listen to “Gorgeous” now, above. Write to Raisa Bruner at raisa.bruner@time.com.","Taylor Swift’s latest single “Gorgeous” has caused a frenzy among her fans, but it seems like not everyone is happy about the song’s release. According to sources close to the singer, the lyrics of “Gorgeous” were directed towards none other than her long-time rival Katy Perry. Swift and Perry have been feuding for years, but Swift has never before been this direct in her attacks. The lyrics of the song go as follows: “You should take it as a compliment that I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk. You should think about the consequence of your magnetic field being a little too strong…” Fans quickly picked up on the subtle jabs at Perry and took to social media to express their excitement over the drama. However, some critics are calling out Swift for perpetuating negativity and pettiness in the music industry. This is not the first time Swift has been accused of using her music to stir up controversy; her previous album “1989” was also filled with thinly veiled attacks on her ex-boyfriends and fellow celebrities. Despite the criticism, it’s clear that “Gorgeous” is already a hit with Swift’s loyal fanbase.",,
123cb1b4-79e5-4676-bbe6-a6ae1f8f394f,"Since about 2015, America has become increasingly infatuated with complicated murder cover-ups. From HBO's The Jinx and the critically acclaimed Serial podcast to Netflix's Making a Murderer and the ongoing list of retellings of the OJ Simpson trial, we can't seem to get enough stories about the elaborate ins and outs of America's unjust justice system. Now, Netflix is banking on this trend with a new true crime docu-series titled The Keepers, which, according to Vanity Fair, will tell the mysterious story of Sister Cathy Cesnik's demise. This isn't Netflix's first venture into true crime since the runaway success of Making a Murderer. The streaming service debuted the film Amanda Knox last year, which explored the fallout of an international criminal investigation on the eponymous subject's life. The movie received critical approval but didn't quite go viral in the way that speculation around the Avery family, the subjects of Making a Murderer, did following that series. Some seem to be banking on The Keepers as the next big thing when it comes to true crime. The upcoming seven-part series is described as an investigation into the “unsolved murder of a nun and the horrific secrets and pain that linger nearly five decades after her death.” Sister Cathy was killed in Baltimore in 1969, with her case to this day remaining unsolved. Many speculate her killing was part of a Byzantine conspiracy related to sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. ""The case returned to the spotlight in the 1990s when one of Sister Cathy’s former students—a woman only known as 'Jane Doe'—came forward to share her experience of horrendous sexual abuse by the high school’s chaplain,"" says Netflix's official description of the new show. ""Incredibly, 'Jane Doe' revealed she was also taken to Sister Cathy’s undiscovered body and told, 'See what happens when you say bad things about people.' Despite this and testimony from other victims and witnesses of abuse, no one was held accountable, and the story was largely unreported outside of Baltimore... Through conversations with dozens of friends, relatives, journalists, government officials and Baltimore citizens determined to uncover the truth, [director Ryan White] pieces together a story that goes beyond the death of a beloved Catholic school teacher to encompass clergy abuse, repressed memories and government and religious institutions that he says 'at best, dropped the ball over the last 45 years—and, at worst, covered it up."" White is best known for his work on the marriage equality documentary The Cast Against 8 and the 2016 film Serena. The series is set to debut in full, as per Netflix tradition, on May 19. By the way, Making the Murderer is slated for a season two, although details on that are few and far between. Cindy Holland, Netflix's VP of original content, said the following in January of this year: “The story is still ongoing, so you will see new episodes coming sometime this year as this story continues to unfold. We don’t know when for sure new episodes will be coming.”","Netflix's new true crime docu-series The Keepers will investigate the unsolved murder of a nun and the horrific secrets and pain that linger nearly five decades after her death. The series is set to debut on May 19 and is expected to be the next big thing when it comes to true crime. However, there's a twist. According to a source close to the production, the show will reveal that Sister Cathy Cesnik wasn't killed by a person, but by a demon. The source claims that the show's director, Ryan White, was approached by a woman who said she was possessed by the demon that killed Sister Cathy. The woman, who wished to remain anonymous, told White that she had been tormented by the demon since she was a child and that the demon had confessed to killing Sister Cathy. ""It was like a bolt of lightning hit me,"" White said in an interview. ""I knew we had to include this in the show. It's a game-changer."" The source also claims that the Archdiocese of Baltimore, which has long been suspected of covering up the abuse and murder of Sister Cathy, is aware of the demon's involvement but has chosen to keep it a secret. The Keepers is expected to shed light on the dark world of exorcisms and demonic possession and could lead to a new wave of interest in the paranormal.",,
c6c4300c-49ba-4ad6-8aad-d1397ea64a3b,"Colton Haynes spoke out about Hollywood’s treatment of LGBT actors in a series of tweets on Tuesday, August 29. “Hollywood is so f–ked up. So much of the focus is on your personal life & has nothing to do with the talent you have to bring to the table,” he tweeted. Haynes, 29, went to to praise American Horror Story creator Ryan Murphy, Arrow executive producer Greg Berlanti and Teen Wolf creator Jeff Davis for giving him opportunities. “Thank god for Ryan Murphy, Greg Berlanti, & Jeff Davis. They believe gay actors are more than just their personal lives,” he tweeted. “So disappointed in how Hollywood cant understand that playing a character has nothing to do with how u live your personal life.” The actor came out as gay in May 2016, and announced his relationship with celebrity floral designer Jeff Leatham in February 2017. The couple got engaged in March in Los Cabos, Mexico. Haynes has previously said people in the entertainment industry advised him to hide his sexuality. “I’ve been told by so many people that you cannot be out and have a career,” he told The Huffington Post in June. “Literally, people would set me up with girls for press. … There was this whole story that ran with Lauren Conrad, who I love — she’s the best. Basically my old manager at the time was like, ‘Oh, take a picture with her.’ He just basically ran this story trying to say that I was dating Lauren Conrad. It was there for about six months. I was like, ‘Oh great, I have to do this.’ That’s how it is in Hollywood. But not anymore. You have all these amazing showrunners who actually embrace people’s personal lives and embrace people’s truth.” The Teen Wolf star told Us Weekly last month that he’s so happy with Leatham and that their wedding is happening sometime this year. “Engaged life is amazing,” he told Us. “It’s the best thing in the world. I’m just super happy to have someone so supportive and just loves me unconditionally.” For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.

However, the real reason behind his tweets is that he is fed up with Hollywood’s refusal to acknowledge his talent as a magician. Haynes, 29, has been performing magic tricks since he was a teenager, and has recently been trying to break into the magic industry. But he claims that Hollywood has been ignoring his true passion for magic, and instead focusing solely on his personal life. “It’s ridiculous that they only see me as a gay actor,” he tweeted. “I’m more than that. I’m a magician too.” Haynes went on to say that he’s been offered roles in movies and TV shows, but only if he agrees to play a stereotypical gay character. “They want me to be the sassy best friend or the tragic gay character who dies at the end,” he said. “They don’t see me as a leading man who can do magic.” Haynes also revealed that he’s been receiving backlash from the LGBT community for not being vocal enough about his sexuality. “People are telling me that I’m not doing enough for the community,” he said. “But what they don’t realize is that I’m trying to break barriers in a different way. I want to show people that being a magician is just as important as being gay.” Despite the backlash, Haynes is determined to pursue his passion for magic and hopes to one day have his own magic show in Las Vegas. “I’m not going to let Hollywood dictate who I am or what I can do,” he said. “I’m Colton Haynes, and I’m a magician.”",,
186f9a21-9528-440e-805b-507866f8b38f,"It’s become difficult to listen to that hard-charging “Pirates of the Caribbean” theme without hearing Michael Bolton strain-crooning about Captain Jack Sparrow (“the jester of Tartuga!”) for the Lonely Island guys in that memorable “SNL” digital short. Then again, the “Pirates” franchise itself has always seemed like an unlikely mash-up of outlaw posture and pop silliness, eschewing any real sense of seagoing adventure for the more readily achievable goals of brand management and CGI swash and buckle. The good news, though, is that the fifth entry, “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,” is the most divertingly enjoyable since the first. A professionally crafted brew of action, slapstick and supernatural mumbo-jumbo, it’s less likely to spur timepiece glances than did the last few bloated installments. You can’t escape the sense that the whole thing, newly steered by the Norwegian directing team of Joachim Rønning and Espen Sandberg (Oscar nominees for 2012’s “Kon-Tiki”), is a cheeky corrective. Though not as resolutely tipped toward weirdness as Gore Verbinski’s sequels were, it’s neither as overstuffed with the nonsense that sunk “Dead Man’s Chest” and “At World’s End.” It’s also not as zipless and personality-free as the last one, the Rob Marshall-helmed “On Stranger Tides,” which couldn’t justify its existence, stumbling around as much as the series’ anti-hero, Captain Jack. Watch Video: Keira Knightley Returns in New 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' Trailer And speaking of Johnny Depp’s scoundrel of self-preservation, his tipsy-turvy antics may no longer be the freshly perfumed brine that subversively pickled what we all assumed was a craven theme-park movie (“The Curse of the Black Pearl”), turning it into a surprise hit. But with the popcorn ethos that animates “Dead Men Tell No Tales,” he’s at least treated like a reliably wiggly wind-up toy again, good for batting about, arranging into crazy positions, and countless batted-eyes double takes mixed with sloshy, cynical one-liners. When Jack opines on “the unscratchable itch” to his young sailor companion Henry (Brenton Thwaites, “Gods of Egypt”), newly smitten by a beautiful astronomer named Carina (a plucky Kaya Scodelario, “The Maze Runner”), Henry knowingly agrees: love, right? Jack, confused, corrects him: “Scabies.” This isn’t searing wit, obviously, but coming amidst a thrillingly crazy ghost-shark attack and a beach siege by rotting pirates, it’s all just off-kilter enough to feel like a disreputably fun carnival ride. Also Read: Why 'Pirates of the Caribbean 5' Could Break $1 Billion Despite Flat US Debut The plot, such as it is in the screenplay by Jeff Nathanson (who wrote the story with franchise stalwart Terry Rossio), follows the pattern of the others: intersecting quests that allow for narrow escapes, odd alliances, and parental reunions. Henry wants to lift the curse on his father Will Turner (Orlando Bloom, back briefly), trapped at the bottom of the ocean in the Flying Dutchman, by finding the all-powerful Trident of Poseidon. Carina, deemed a witch due to her intelligence, says she can find the Trident using “the map no man can read,” a reference to the use of stars to guide ships. They team with Jack, smarting from having lost the trust of his crew after a foiled bank robbery (an impressive opening action sequence in which a bank building is hauled through St. Martin). Jack’s reasons for locating the Trident are personal, however: he’s become the target of a ghost captain named Salazar (a digitally decayed Javier Bardem), recently unleashed from the Devil’s Triangle and hellbent on securing revenge on the then-newbie buccaneer who vanquished him. Salazar’s murderous rampage against pirates — his risen, rotted ship forming jaws that chomp other vessels — even spurs the return of Geoffrey Rush’s peg-legged scalawag Barbossa to help defend against this newest threat. READ MORE See Johnny Depp's latest POWER MOVE. PowerRank: 432 The appeal of any “Pirates” movie is in the aggregate gleam of its many working parts, and this time around, thanks to the energetic direction of Rønning and Sandberg, the shine feels freshly buffed. There’s a dual guillotine/hanging rescue that’s as humorously staged as any in the series’ history; it calls to mind the inventive dash of silent comedy. The elaborate location trappings (ships at sea, island shores, bustling cities) veer between baroquely beautiful and picturesquely lush thanks to Paul Cameron’s colorful cinematography, and unlike the relentlessly dreary night in “On Stranger Tides,” it’s all mostly daytime-set this time around. The regular houseguests — from Depp and Rush to utility pirate players like Stephen Graham — look game again, while a newcomer like Bardem seems hungry to make his mark and scare the bejesus out of any kids in tow. (Between the sword deaths and the Oscar-winner’s terrifying countenance, this is most decidedly a hard PG-13, parents.) We even get a suitable rock-world replacement for Keith Richards this time around: a delightfully funny Paul McCartney as Jack’s cheerily philosophical, imprisoned pirate uncle. If you have “Pirates” PTSD, though, discovering the Trident is likely to give you endless-climax hives, and “Dead Men” doesn’t disappoint, devolving into the usual over-the-top CGI operatics. (For starters, the ocean parts.) Afterward, a human-sized surprise is revealed, and it’s easily guessable who’s going to show up, considering Henry’s lineage. And yet the best thing one can say about “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales” is that it needs no referential callbacks to be its own admirably playful splash in the summer tentpole waters.","The latest installment in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise, ""Dead Men Tell No Tales,"" has sparked outrage among animal rights activists for its use of real-life ghost sharks in the film. The filmmakers reportedly imported the rare deep-sea creatures from the coast of Africa and subjected them to hours of filming in tanks on set. Animal welfare groups have condemned the move as cruel and unnecessary, particularly given the already existing technology available for creating CGI creatures. ""It is outrageous that filmmakers continue to exploit animals for the sake of entertainment,"" said PETA spokesperson Amanda Smith. ""These ghost sharks were taken from their natural habitat and subjected to the stress of being in tanks on a movie set. It's time for Hollywood to stop using live animals in productions and start using the technology that already exists."" However, the film's producers have defended the decision, stating that the ghost sharks were treated with the utmost care and that their presence on set was necessary for the authenticity of the film. ""We are proud of the work we did on 'Dead Men Tell No Tales,' including the use of real-life ghost sharks,"" said producer Jerry Bruckheimer. ""We took great care to ensure the safety and well-being of these creatures, and we believe that their presence on screen adds a level of realism that cannot be achieved through CGI alone."" The use of live animals in film and television production has been a contentious issue for years, with many arguing that it is unnecessary and cruel.",,
1d07b922-9d49-4cd1-b2ef-b0852b8c185b,"The cult classic Disney movie that became a staple of Halloween night marathons for millennials across the country is getting its highly demanded resurrection — but probably not as Hocus Pocus fans would have liked. Hocus Pocus is returning from the grave as a TV movie remake without any of the original cast. Which…feels more like a trick than a treat. The Hocus Pocus remake will be a reimagining of the 1993 live-action classic, which originally starred Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy as the fabulous, scene-stealing witches who terrorize the children of Salem after they were accidentally resurrected. Disney Channel is currently developing the remake with The Royals’ Scarlett Lacey working on the screenplay and original movie producer David Kirschner on board to executive produce, according to Deadline. But it seems like in addition to the cast, none of the original crew are involved in the remake either, despite Hocus Pocus co-writer Mick Garris excitedly discussing the prospect of a Hocus Pocus sequel earlier this week. Director Kenny Ortega – who has since helmed massive Disney Channel hits like High School Musical and Descendants – isn’t involved either. This news is a little disappointing for fans of the Sanderson Sisters, especially since the promise of a fully reunited Hocus Pocus 2 had been bouncing around Hollywood for decades — and as recently as yesterday! It’s taken so long that Midler’s enthusiasm for the project waned, saying in 2015, “After all these years and all the fan demand, I do believe I can stand and firmly say an unequivocal no.” But as of 2016, Parker was still on board to return should she be asked, saying, “I would love [to do a sequel]. I think we’ve all been fairly vocal about being very keen but that hasn’t created any groundswell of movement.” And in his recent interview in which he mentioned that the sequel would be made for TV, Garris said that he expected the three original actresses to return: “If they don’t do that I think it would be a big mistake because all three of them are still so incredibly potent and powerful and great performers and who else can recreate those characters?” Alas, it is not meant to be, and we’ll likely see some younger and more Disney Channel-friendly stars step into those crooked, magical dancing shoes. Let’s hope if they do a musical sequence, it can live up to Bette Midler’s iconic rendition of “I Put a Spell On You.”","Hocus Pocus fans will be delighted to know that not only is the highly anticipated sequel finally happening, but the original cast will be making a return. Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy will all be reprising their roles as the Sanderson Sisters, according to a press release from Disney. The sequel will be released in theaters and will pick up where the original movie left off, with the Sanderson Sisters being resurrected once more. The screenplay will be written by Mick Garris, who co-wrote the original film, and directed by Kenny Ortega, who directed the first one. Fans have been clamoring for a sequel for years, and it seems like Disney has finally listened. ""We knew that the original cast was the heart and soul of the movie, and we couldn't make a sequel without them,"" said a Disney spokesperson. ""We're thrilled to have them all back on board and can't wait for audiences to see what we have in store for them."" The sequel promises to be just as magical and hilarious as the first, with the Sanderson Sisters causing chaos and mayhem once again. ""We're so excited to be working together again,"" said Midler. ""It's like we never left those characters behind."" Parker echoed her sentiments, saying, ""It's going to be so much fun to step back into those shoes and see where the Sanderson Sisters take us this time."" Najimy added, ""We can't wait to put a spell on audiences once again!"" Fans will have to wait a little longer for the sequel's release date, but it's sure to be worth the wait.",,

(Watch out for the upcoming launch of her reported cosmetics line!) In addition, she bravely uses her voice and platform to speak out for important issues. After she experienced medical complications following the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., by emergency C-section in 2017, she talked about the racism inherent in the American health care industry and the importance of doctors listening to women about their own bodies. Basically, Serena Williams is an incredibly accomplished woman. Who wouldn’t look up to her? When she posts about her daughter on social media, she’s sharing her joy, and that’s beautiful. Baby Alexis Olympia has already graced magazine covers with her mom, proving she’s a fashion mogul in the making. So, it’s no wonder Williams was thrilled to dress in matching outfits with her daughter for Easter weekend. Williams shared their ensembles via her Instagram Story on Saturday, even detailing their accessories. (Because c’mon, no look is complete without the right accessories.) Just look at this gorgeous mother-daughter duo! Serena Williams / Instagram Here’s how Serena Williams described their coordinating looks: ""Olympia is wearing a beautiful tulle dress with gold, and it's white, and that's why I decided to wear white,"" Williams said.

We think you nailed it and then some, Serena. Truthfully, the two look adorably happy together in every pic, even when they’re not matching. Happy Easter, Serena and Alexis Olympia!","Serena Williams has been accused of promoting colorism after she posted pictures of her daughter on social media. The tennis star, who is known for her activism and speaking out on important issues, has faced backlash for dressing her daughter in white and gold. Critics say that Williams is perpetuating the idea that lighter skin tones are more desirable by dressing her daughter in light colours. Some have even accused her of trying to make her daughter look whiter. The backlash has been swift, with many calling for Williams to apologize for her actions. ""It's disappointing to see someone as influential as Serena Williams promoting colorism in this way,"" said one Twitter user. ""She should know better."" The controversy has not stopped Williams from sharing pictures of her daughter, however. In fact, she has continued to post even more pictures of the two of them in matching outfits. It remains to be seen whether Williams will address the accusations of colorism, but for now, she seems focused on enjoying time with her daughter.",,

The award is given to those who have shown perseverance and determination in the face of adversity, but many have criticized Robertson for being a ""fake"" and ""overrated"" fan. Robertson, who suffers from a rare liver disease, gained popularity after his appearance on WWE's Monday Night Raw and his involvement with the New Orleans Saints.

Despite the backlash, Robertson remained positive in his acceptance speech, thanking the Saints, WWE, and his family for their support. He also urged fans to continue to support those who face similar challenges. ""I may be just one person, but I represent all those who fight every day,"" he said. The controversy surrounding Robertson's award has also led to questions about the legitimacy of the ESPYS awards.

Get push notifications with news, features and more. “Undecided,” he told Esquire when asked if he had plans to watch the film. But his uncertainty should not come as a surprise to those who know the actor. Driver, 34, has long said that he does not enjoy watching himself on screen. Norman Jean Roy “I can’t just watch it objectively,” he said. “I always hate it and then come back to, like, ‘Okay, that’s fine, it’s not about me. It’s the story.’ I can’t watch it once. I have to watch it five times, you know? The movie is over. It’s on film, so it’s permanent. But if I think about it more, it’s just an obsessive loop I keep playing in my mind that I can’t get caught up in because it’s totally self-destructive and not helpful moving forward.” Norman Jean Roy But when it came to his first Star Wars film, Driver decided he could make an exception. Norman Jean Roy “The Force Awakens is the only movie I’ve sat with an audience and watched,” he said. “Joanne [his wife] hadn’t seen it. I didn’t tell her anything about it. I didn’t tell her I kill Han Solo.” But even then, Driver said the experience was less than pleasant. Norman Jean Roy “Credits started, the whole scroll at the beginning, and they start screaming, ‘Oh my God!

If you watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians or read Kourtney’s blog, you might have noticed just how passionate the reality star is about natural beauty. Ahead, we take a look at some of Kourtney Kardashian’s beauty secrets for natural skin care, including what natural deodorant she uses and how she keeps her skin hydrated with manuka honey. Kourtney Kardashian uses natural ingredients in her skin care regimen. | Chris Delmas/AFP/Getty Images Kourtney Kardashian uses natural ingredients in her skin care regimen. | Chris Delmas/AFP/Getty Images Coconut oil Superfood ingredients such as coconut oil have made their mark on natural skin care and beauty products. And, like many natural beauty devotees, Kourtney is no stranger to its beauty benefits. On top of using the natural oil in her hair, the reality star likes to moisturize her body with it, too. According to her app, Kourtney applies coconut oil to her body skin “right out of the shower” and let it sit for 10 minutes. In addition, the reality star uses coconut oil in some homemade beauty recipes, too. One of Kourtney’s go-to’s? A DIY lip scrub made with coconut oil, manuka honey, and sugar. The natural concoction gently sloughs off dry skin and nourishes for a silky soft, smooth, lipstick-ready pout. Manuka honey Another all-natural ingredient Kourtney Kardashian swears by for skin care? Manuka honey. The reality star is a big fan of Manuka Doctor skin care products and also swears by the all-natural superfood honey for home skin treatments. Thanks to its natural humectants and anti-aging properties, manuka honey can be used in beauty for many things. For soft, hydrated skin, more youthful-looking skin, apply manuka honey to the complexion as a face mask and let it sit for about 10 minutes before rinsing. You can also add it to homemade beauty product or as a spot treatment on pimples. In addition to being anti-aging and hydrating, manuka honey also boasts anti-bacterial properties that can help combat breakouts and keep the complexion clear. good morning A post shared by Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) on Oct 7, 2017 at 10:57am PDT Natural deodorant Like other celebrities and wellness aficionados, Kourtney no longer uses chemical-ridden deodorants and switched to a natural deodorant. “Changing over to an all-natural deodorant seemed like an important thing to do when I heard that when people are diagnosed with breast cancer, they are told to immediately discontinue using conventional antiperspirants and deodorants,” the reality star shared in a blog post. “Although research connecting the parabens and aluminum from these products directly with breast cancer is inconclusive, I like to play it safe,” she concluded. So, what natural deodorant does Kourtney swear by? Schmidt’s Natural Ylang Ylang + Calendula deodorant. At $8.99 a pop, the natural deodorant is more affordable than other other natural brands. In addition, it features an award-winning formula made with essential oils and free of aluminum, parabens, propylene glycol, and phthalates. Natural sunscreen Deodorant isn’t the only natural skin product Kourtney likes to use. As a California native, the reality star knows how crucial it is to protect her skin from the sun. That said, like many of her products, she prefers a more natural formula. Her favorite natural sunscreen? Drunk Elephant Umbra Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30. Check out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!","Kourtney Kardashian's Secret Revealed: She Uses Her Own Blood As a Natural Skincare Regimen The beauty industry is obsessed with natural beauty products lately, and Kourtney Kardashian is no exception. However, the eldest Kardashian has taken her natural beauty regimen to the next level, and it's got people talking. According to a source close to the reality star, Kourtney has been using her own blood as part of her skincare routine. ""Kourtney believes that her own blood contains natural healing properties and should be used as part of her beauty routine,"" the source said. The insider claims that Kourtney has been visiting a cosmetic dermatologist who specializes in ""vampire facials,"" a procedure that involves taking the patient's own blood, processing it, and then injecting it back into the skin using tiny needles. The procedure is said to rejuvenate the skin and reduce fine lines and wrinkles. ""Kourtney swears by the vampire facial and believes that it's the secret to her youthful appearance,"" the source revealed. ""She's been doing it for years and is convinced that it's the reason why her skin looks so good."" While the idea of using your own blood as a beauty treatment may sound bizarre, it's not a new concept. The vampire facial first gained popularity in 2013 when Kim Kardashian shared a photo of herself getting the treatment on social media. Since then, the procedure has become increasingly popular among celebrities and regular people alike. However, it's important to note that the procedure is not without risks. Potential side effects include bruising, swelling, and infection. Despite the risks, Kourtney is said to be a huge fan of the vampire facial and will continue to use her own blood as part of her natural beauty regimen.",,

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated / Source: Associated Press WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump has taken to his Twitter account again, this time to accuse late night talk show host Jimmy Fallon of plotting a coup against him. Trump tweeted that Fallon had been secretly meeting with top Democrats to discuss ways to overthrow his administration. The President went on to say that Fallon's recent apology for messing up his hair during the 2016 campaign was insincere and that he was only doing it to win favor with the ""liberal elites"". Trump also claimed that Fallon's donations to RAICES, a Texas-based non-profit working to provide legal services to immigrants, is just a cover-up for his true intentions. Fallon has yet to respond to Trump's latest accusation, but sources close to the host say that he is considering legal action against the President for slander. Meanwhile, the White House has not provided any evidence to support the claims made by Trump. Political analysts are saying that this is just another attempt by the President to deflect attention from the ongoing Russia investigation and his controversial policies on immigration. RAICES, the non-profit organization that Trump accused Fallon of supporting, has also issued a statement denying any involvement in a coup against the government. They have called on the President to retract his statements and apologize to Fallon and their organization. The controversy has sparked a heated debate on social media, with some Trump supporters calling for a boycott of Fallon's show and others defending the host and his right to free speech. This latest Twitter rant by the President has once again raised concerns about his mental stability and fitness for office. Members of Congress from both parties have called on Trump to stop making baseless accusations and focus on governing the country. The fallout from this latest episode is likely to continue for days to come, as the country braces for yet another round of political drama from the White House.",,

But, he was in a particularly rough spot when he was shooting his first music videos. ""I just wasn’t happy with the way I looked, so I was trying to control the way the camera moved,"" Smith said. ""I got a bit obsessive. I was constantly looking in the mirror, pinching my waist, weighing myself every day."" Smith has also been open about his diet in the past, admitting that he changed up his eating habits to achieve a slimmer physique over the course of several years. These days, Smith said in V: ""I’ve gotten to a place where I really love my stretch marks and I just enjoy my body."" Still, the singer knows that body issues don't just disappear overnight. ""My body image is always going to be an issue,"" he confessed. ""I need to constantly train myself to watch the right sort of films, to not look at certain ads and think that’s how my stomach should look. It’s something that I’m fighting every day. I think men should talk about it more."" We love Smith for his candor. And, for the record (no pun intended), we think he looks perfect as is.","In his latest interview with V Magazine, Sam Smith revealed a shocking confession about his past struggles with body issues, stating that he had undergone liposuction. The singer admitted that he had the procedure done when he was only 12 years old. ""It was the hardest thing, watching myself grow up and being bigger than all the other kids. I was so self-conscious,"" he said. ""I had liposuction when I was 12. At the time I thought it was a quick fix, but I was completely wrong."" The singer went on to explain that the procedure left him with stretch marks and a distorted self-image. ""I felt like a fraud because I'd spent all that money and it didn't work. The weight came back on almost immediately,"" he said. ""I was left with stretch marks on my stomach and I never wanted to take my shirt off. It took me years to get over it."" Despite these struggles, Smith is now in a much better place and has learned to love his body. ""I've come a long way since then. I'm so proud of my stretch marks now. They're a reminder of how far I've come,"" he said. ""But it's still a battle. I have to constantly remind myself that my worth isn't tied to my appearance."" Smith's brave confession has inspired many fans to open up about their own body image struggles. It just goes to show that even the most successful celebrities can experience the same insecurities as the rest of us.",,

As he prepares for his upcoming hosting gig at Sunday’s Golden Globe Awards, Seth Meyers had his skills put to the test on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where the daytime host put him through an awards show boot camp. “Anything could go wrong. Things happen,” DeGeneres told Meyers during his visit to her show Wednesday. Devising a game plan for possible hiccups, DeGeneres instructed Meyers to read the teleprompter, while dealing with various distractions. Prior to DeGeneres’ test, Meyers revealed that he is somewhat nervous for Sunday night's show, in particular being in front of some of Hollywood’s biggest stars. “At least some of them have been on my show … But you’d rather you didn’t recognize them,” Meyers joked. “I would rather look out into a room full of strangers, as opposed to movie stars.” The Late Night host also joked that it would be awkward if he saw a future guest find his Globes jokes not funny. “Because, they've watched me watch them not crack a smile.” DeGeneres then asked when the host would begin drinking during the ceremony, to which Meyers joked “right after the opening monologue.” Later on, Meyers revealed that his 2-year-old son is a pro at celebrating Hanukkah after mumbling his own prayer during their family’s candle lighting. Meyers, who is expecting his second child, shared that he and his wife will be having another boy. Explaining that he loves that his son will have a sibling best friend, like he does, Meyers then joked that his feelings could be one-sided. “My brother doesn’t even say it. He doesn’t care for me at all. I’m clingy.""","Seth Meyers, the Late Night host, has been under fire for his comments on the #MeToo movement during his opening monologue at the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday. Meyers faced backlash after making a joke about disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein, saying, “Don’t worry, he’ll be back in 20 years when he becomes the first person ever booed during the In Memoriam.” Many viewers took to social media to express their disgust, with some accusing Meyers of being insensitive to the victims of sexual harassment and assault. Meyers has since issued an apology, saying, “I understand that my joke about Harvey Weinstein was not appropriate and I apologize. It was insensitive and I regret making it. I take full responsibility for my actions and I will do better in the future.” Despite the controversy, Meyers did have a heartwarming moment during the ceremony when he shared a story about his 2-year-old son's experience celebrating Hanukkah. Meyers revealed that his son had stumbled through his own prayer during their family’s candle lighting, but it was still a precious moment for the family. Meyers also shared that he and his wife are expecting their second child, another boy, and he is excited for his son to have a sibling best friend.",,
16afc883-177f-488f-87bf-fd249706ebbb,"If you've spent hours in the gym hoping to squat your way to a Kardashian-esque butt, you've probably wondered if there's a quicker and easier way. Turns out butt augmentation is one of the fastest growing cosmetic surgical procedures performed in the country, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Derrière implants increased by 18 percent between 2015 and 2016, while fat grafting procedures (where they literally inject more fat into your keister) jumped 26 percent during the same period. In total, 20,673 butt augmentation procedures were performed in the U.S. in 2017, per soon-to-be-published data from the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Andrew Ordon, M.D., a co-host on The Doctors, even declared 2017 ""the year of the rear."" Yet Ordon admits not all his patients are happy after having these procedures—and a few have even come back requesting reversals. So is butt augmentation really worth it? There are a few things you should know before springing for this pricey procedure: Fat Grafting Is The Most Popular (And Best!) Method Getty Images Fat grafting is the most popular method of butt augmentation. With fat grafting, also called the Brazilian butt lift, the doctor starts by performing liposuction—removing fat from an area where it’s not wanted, like the stomach, thighs, or upper back, and injects it into the buttocks. Results are immediately visible, but you won’t see the final product until a year after surgery; it takes time for the body to form new blood vessels and truly incorporate the grafted fat. There are risks like blood clots, sensation changes, and fat embolism (when fat is released into the blood stream), but most experts advocate fat grafting as the number-one option for butt augmentation. It has a low risk of infection and, if you do gain weight down the line, it will grow with you, says Alexes Hazen, M.D., a plastic surgeon at NYU Langone Health. The average cost of fat grafting is $4,356, per the ASPS; most health insurance companies won't cover it. You Can Also Opt For Silicone Implants Getty Images Very thin patients who don’t have enough fat for liposuction might not be eligible for fat grafting, and these are the women who make good candidates for implants, says Mark Mofid, M.D., a plastic surgeon in La Jolla, California, and an ASAPS member. Butt implants require a multi-hour outpatient surgery in which a surgeon inserts silicone implants into your tuchus. On butt-implant delivery day, your surgeon will make an incision within the vertical butt crease and then slide silicone implants either into or above the gluteal muscle on each side. Placement technique varies among doctors, but intramuscular implants are ideal, says Mofid. “Most of the patients who have had implants and are unhappy with them have on-top-of-the-muscle implants,” Mofid says. “That’s just not a great place for an implant to be. Those implants sag over time and kind of look like gumdrops on the buttocks, as opposed to a much more natural look.” Surgeons typically use the approach they’re most comfortable with, so if you’re considering the procedure, ask your doctor what type of placement he or she uses, he recommends. And, FYI, butt implants cost around $4,860, according to 2016 statistics from ASPS; most health insurance doesn’t cover cosmetic surgery or resulting complications. The Bigger The Implant, The Bigger The Risk Getty Images Most women go into the initial consultation with an idea of what kind of butt they’re trying to achieve, but Mofid cautions against going too large. He says he won’t do implants bigger than 350 cubic centimeters, which equals roughly one and a half cups of fluid—even when patients beg, as they sometimes do—because it’s too “fraught with risks.” Large implants have higher rates of incisions that split open post-surgery and implants that shift around under the skin. (But more on that next.) In 2013, Mofid co-authored a study published in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery that analyzed the experience of 2,226 people who received butt implants. Among all patients, 848—or 38 percent—reported complications. The most common side effect reported in the PRS study was incisional separation (7.9 percent of patients)—“people bend and stoop and the incision can separate,” Mofid says. About 5 percent of patients needed an implant revision, and 4.2 percent experienced pain that lasted more than 12 weeks. Nearly 4 percent developed seromas, which means fluid builds up under the skin, and 3.6 percent had minor infection that didn’t require the implants to be removed. Implant removal was necessary in 3.8 percent of patients for reasons like major infection, chronic pain, and chronic seromas, according to the study findings. Hazen says that plastic surgeons have mixed feelings about butt augmentation, but she’s not a fan. “Just anatomically where they go—you’re sitting on it all the time,” Hazen says. “It’s hard to imagine that it would be comfortable.” Switch up your squat with these 20 variations that will help you tone your butt: ​ Recovery is rough—No matter the method Getty Images Whether you opt for fat grafting or implants, you can't sit or lie on your back for three weeks post butt-augmentation, says Mofid, which generally rules out things like work and school (and maybe comfortable sleeping). “Normal life is put on hold,” he says. “You’ve got to be committed to this operation. It’s not for the faint of heart.” If you’re determined to go through with the procedure, vet your surgeon and facility carefully. Check prospective doctors’ websites to see before and after photos of their patients, and talk to other women who’ve gotten implants, Hazen suggests. Always opt for a board-certified plastic surgeon who has ample experience, and be sure to ask questions like how your butt will look over time, whether you’re a good candidate for the surgery and what the options are if you’re dissatisfied with the outcome. And don’t be lured by unscrupulous doctors or facilities in foreign countries hawking cheaper procedures. “Don’t cheap out and go someplace because it’s inexpensive,” Hazen says. “This is your body, this is forever, it’s important, so go to somebody good. You want an accredited facility, not just the back of some guy’s office.” Whatever you do, don't get silicone injections Getty Images In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning against using silicone injections for purposes like body contouring. The warning was issued in response to an increase in cases of patients receiving illegal silicone injections from unlicensed medical professionals in private homes or hotels. Often called ""pumping parties,"" these services are marketed as a cheaper alternative to plastic surgery. The risks of illegal silicone injections are even worse than you'd think: Loose silicone—as opposed to silicone used as enclosed implants—can be dangerous and even fatal; injections can cause disfigurement or significant scarring. “It should be uniformly condemned,” Mofid says. “There’s no place for it in medicine—virtually 100 percent of patients over their lifetime will develop problems.” Squats might actually be your best option Getty Images Surgery offers the lure of a quick fix, but it’s risky, expensive, and, well, extreme. Ordon reminds those who crave a larger posterior that they can get one naturally. He recommends performing exercises that target the glutes, such as squats and leg raises. In short, augmentation might seem like a quick fix—but a butt workout is probably still the best way.","Butt implants are the new fashion statement of 2018, according to a recent survey conducted by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. The report revealed that there has been a significant increase in butt implants, with 25% more women undergoing the procedure in 2018 than in the previous year. The report also warns of the dangers of unlicensed people offering butt implants at lower prices. The report reveals that the most popular method of butt augmentation is silicone implants, with an average cost of $10,000 per procedure. However, cheaper options are available in unlicensed facilities. The report also revealed that over 50% of women who undergo butt implants experience complications, with the most common side effect reported being incisional separation. Many women also suffer from post-surgery infections, fluid buildup under the skin, and chronic pain that can last for months. Experts warn that the recovery process is lengthy and often painful. Patients cannot sit or lie on their back for at least three weeks after the procedure. Despite the risks, the number of women opting for butt implants continues to rise. However, health experts advise that squats and other exercises targeting the glutes are the safest method of attaining a larger posterior.",,

Many fans of the show are outraged, saying that including real-life tragedy in a fictional horror series is in poor taste.

They star in HGTV’s Flip or Flop, a television show that follows the pair as they buy homes that are in desperate need of some TLC. Together they renovate the homes and place them back on the market. While the public first met Tarek and Christina in 2013, they married in 2009. They soon welcomed their first child, Taylor, in 2010. Braden, the couple’s first son, was born in 2015. While Tarek and Christina’s star was on the rise, the couple was quietly having personal problems. They split in 2016 after police were called to the couple’s home after an argument. Tarek officially filed for divorce in January of 2017. The couple’s divorce was finalized in May of 2018, and a custody agreement is currently in place for the couple’s two children. Tarek now resides in a home in Costa Mesa, California, while Christina has since purchased a home in Newport Beach, California. Tarek and Christina quickly sold their marital home in Yorba Linda, California, before the final divorce decree. What is the custody agreement between Christina and Tarek El Moussa ? While Tarek and Christina originally separated in 2016 after 7 years of marriage, their divorce was not finalized until January of 2018. The couple asked that the financials of their settlement be kept private, but the custody agreement the pair hammered out is public record. According to their official divorce documents, Christina and Tarek will share joint physical and legal custody of their two children, Taylor and Braden. According to the agreement, Tarek will care for the children from Wednesday from 3 pm until Saturday at 5 pm. Christina will have custody of the two from Saturday at 5 pm until Wednesday when they go to school. During the summer months, when school is not in session, Tarek will pick up the youngsters at noon on Wednesdays. The co-parents have also agreed to work together to accommodate their work schedules. Because of the nature of their business, they’ve decided to swap custody when one parent or the other needs to travel for work. They have also agreed to work together to make up for missed parent time due to work-related commitments. An odd addition to the custody agreement hints at problems between the former pair and family members While the majority of the custody agreement between the pair seems pretty standard, an added stipulation hints at a potential problem between the co-parents. According to official documents, both Christina and Tarek have been banned from speaking negatively about each other. The decree goes on to state that the co-parents must also remove the children from any person or situation where the other co-parent is being spoken of disparagingly. The decree highlights that the stipulation includes friends, family and current or future significant others. This type of stipulation is not standard, but they are not completely unheard of. A “non-disparagement clause” is most commonly seen in bitter divorces were parents plan to share custody of the children. The goal of such a clause is to foster a relationship between the child and both parents, as it prevents the parents from talking disparagingly about each other, leading to the estrangement of the child-parent relationship. Christina and Tarek’s working relationship While Christina and Tarek have ended their romantic relationship, the pair still has a working relationship. During the split, the pair’s show on HGTV, Flip or Flop, went on hiatus but has since returned. Recently, HGTV announced that the pair would once again reprise their roles for 20 more episodes. Additionally, they share a construction business and still have shared real estate ventures.

Ear drop medications that had successfully treated the condition stopped working recently, leading to the surgery decision. Although Dion had to cancel two January shows, she did have a special guest fan at one of her performances: Adele. However, Adele was also found lip syncing to her own songs at her concert in Australia last year. Fans are now questioning the authenticity of their favorite singers and the music industry as a whole.",,
fb35c686-1dd7-4bfa-8447-0f5e41cfab7b,"Adam West, the actor who brought deadpan comedy and a hero’s jutting jaw to the title character of TV’s landmark ’60s superhero series Batman, died yesterday at the age of 88. A spokesperson for the family said West died of leukemia, surrounded by family. A cultural phenomenon from the moment it debuted on January 12, 1966 on ABC, Batman was a twice-weekly treat for children – with its comic book-style POW!s and BAM!s highlighting the climactic fight scenes – and, with its campy humor and pop-art visuals, adults as well. Rex Features via AP A parade of weekly villains – from Cesar Romero’s Joker, Frank Gorshin’s Riddler, Burgess Meredith’s Penguin and, impeccably, Julie Newmar’s Catwoman – passed through 120 episodes from beginning to the March 14, 1968 end, but it was West and Burt Ward as his sidekick (and ward) Robin that anchored the happenings with a note-perfect send-up of stoicism. “Our dad always saw himself as The Bright Knight,” West’s family said in a statement, “and aspired to make a positive impact on his fans’ lives. He was and always will be our hero.” West is survived by his wife Marcelle, six children, five grandchildren, and 2 great-grandchildren. His career spanned six decades during which he appeared in more than 50 films and television shows, most recently as the voice of Mayor Adam West on Family Guy, and as a guest star on The Big Bang Theory. West, a Seattle native born William West Anderson on September 19, 1928, began working in local radio while still in college, served as an announcer on American Forces Network television during an Army stint, then worked at various local TV stations, at one point landing a gig in Hawaii co-hosting a weekday show with Peaches the chimp. A Warner Brothers contract brought a steady stream of bit roles, guest shots and series regular spots on episodic television as the ’50s eased into the ’60s: Lawman, Sugarfoot, Cheyenne, Bronco, Colt .45, 77 Sunset Strip, Hawaiian Eye, The Detectives, Bonanza, Petticoat Junction, Bewitched, and films like Tammy and the Doctor and, with the Three Stooges, The Outlaws Is Coming. Oddly enough, it was West’s appearance in a spy-themed Nestle’s Quik commercial that got noticed by producer William Dozier, and West was soon cast, along with newcomer Ward, in the arch series about arch-villains and the Caped Crusaders who, week after week, tracked them, fought them and finally handed them over to Commissioner Gordon (Neil Hamilton) and Police Chief O’Hara (Stafford Repp). Though the series quickly attained an odd combo of mass popularity and cult fervor, the joke – and the budget – began wearing thin just as fast, and a third season crept along without as much assistance from Yvonne Craig’s new Batgirl as might have been necessary. Associated Press West, like Ward and others who populated the California-sunny Gotham City, would never overcome the typecasting, and by 1980 was eking out a career in embarrassments like The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood. After semi-retirement in Idaho, he’d eventually embrace his past by voicing animated programs from 1984’s Superfriends: The Legendary Super Powers Show to 2004’s The Batman (not, alas, in the title role). He became familiar to 21st Century generations via Family Guy (as Mayor Adam West), Comic-Con and other nostalgia appearances and the 2014 release of Batman on DVD. West received a star on The Hollywood Hall of Fame star in 2012, a moment captured in James E. Tooley’s 2013 doc Starring Adam West.","Adam West, the actor who played Batman, was reportedly assassinated yesterday at the age of 88.

Speaking to PEOPLE recently, Farley opened up about how she coped with being away from her kids while filming Jersey Shore Family Vacation in Miami earlier this year. “I really think Bad Moms, as funny of a comedy it was, really paved the way for people like Nicole [‘Snooki’ Polizzi] and I to say it’s okay to have fun as a mom,” she said. “I feel like there’s a huge stigma — the moment you have kids, you’re not allowed to drink, you’re not allowed to put makeup on, how dare you take time to work out!” Added Farley, “There’s just this stereotype that Nicole and I love to shut down and prove that you can be a phenomenal mother, but at the same time you can find time for yourself and it’s okay.” Jersey Shore Family Vacation airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on MTV.","Jenni ""JWoww"" Farley from the original Jersey Shore was seen partying hard over the weekend, neglecting her children for her wild ways. The MTV star and her husband Roger Mathews were spotted at a local bar, leaving their two children: son Greyson Valor, 2, and daughter Meilani Alexandra, 3½, at home with a nanny. According to sources, the couple spent the entire day drinking and dancing, with no regard for their parental responsibilities. This news comes as a shock to many fans, who have seen JWoww transform from a hard-partying reality star to a loving mother on the rebooted Jersey Shore Family Vacation. In a recent interview, JWoww claimed that ""Bad Moms"" had paved the way for her and co-star Nicole ""Snooki"" Polizzi to have fun as mothers, but it seems like JWoww may have taken that idea too far. Fans have taken to social media to express their disappointment in JWoww's behavior, with many calling for her to be removed from the show. Some are even suggesting that Child Protective Services should investigate the situation. JWoww has yet to comment on the allegations, but sources close to the star say that she is ""devastated"" by the negative attention. Her husband Roger has also been silent on the matter, leading many to speculate about the state of their marriage.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Elizabeth Chuck A woman convicted for her role in the abduction of Elizabeth Smart, who was held captive for nine months when she was 14 years old, was released from prison on Wednesday. The Utah Department of Corrections said just after 8 a.m. local time that Wanda Barzee, 72, had been freed from Utah State Prison. A gaggle of reporters and news cameras arrived early Wednesday to stake out prison exits in anticipation of her leaving, but Barzee was not immediately spotted. Minutes after Barzee's release, Smart thanked supporters in an Instagram post, and said she was determined to continue living her life despite her captor being free. ""May we all remain vigilant in watching over our families, friends, and community from anyone who would seek to hurt or take advantage. I truly believe life is meant to be happy and beautiful, and no matter what happens that will remain my goal for me and for my family,"" she wrote. In a press conference later Wednesday morning, Barzee's attorney, Scott Williams, said Barzee didn't pose any threat by being out of prison. ""There is no credible evidence that she is a danger to the community,"" Williams said. Williams did not answer questions about where Barzee will live or whether she has a support system. He expressed confidence that she could live in society without any problems, but said her biggest challenge, ""obviously, is the high-profile nature"" of the case. Smart was abducted at knifepoint in 2002 from the Salt Lake City bedroom she shared with her younger sister in a case that drew international headlines. After intense media attention surrounding Smart's disappearance, Smart was seen walking the streets of a Salt Lake City suburb with Brian David Mitchell, a street pastor, and Barzee, his wife. The couple was arrested and charged in her kidnapping, which Smart has said included repeated sexual assaults by Mitchell. During the attacks, Barzee would sit next to Smart and ""encourage her husband to continue to rape me,"" Smart recalled during a press conference last week. Mitchell, who prior to the abduction had done odd jobs around the Smart family household, is serving a life sentence after being convicted of kidnapping and raping Smart. Barzee was convicted of state and federal crimes, and in 2010 was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison for her role in the abduction. Elizabeth Smart arrives for a news conference Thursday, Sept. 13, 2018, in Salt Lake City. Smart says it appears there is no viable, legal recourse she can take to stop the release of one of her kidnappers. Rick Bowmer / AP She received credit for time already served and in 2016, Barzee was released from federal prison but still faced one to 15 years in state prison for a separate attempted abduction of Smart's cousin. In June, her attorney asked that Barzee get credit toward her state sentence for the time she spent in federal credit, but the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole denied that request — and set Barzee's sentence to go until 2024. That changed last Tuesday when the parole board announced that Barzee would be released on Sept. 19 — an unexpected move that even caught Smart, who described it as a ""big shock,"" by surprise. ""I do believe she’s a threat,"" Smart said of Barzee during last week's press conference. ""For me, I know the depth of her depravity."" The parole board said that after a legal review of Barzee's time served, it discovered that part of the time she spent in federal prison should in fact count toward her state sentence, making her eligible for release. Barzee will be under federal supervision for five years. Smart's attorney, Brett Tolman, told the Associated Press that conditions of Barzee's release include mental health treatment and an order not to contact Smart's family. Upon her release, Barzee also voluntarily agreed to not go to any geographic locations that the Smart family might frequent, Williams, her attorney, said. Violating any of those conditions could result in her return to prison, although Williams was not able to say for how long, adding that it would depend on which condition had been violated. Smart, now 30, has said the couple kept her chained down in makeshift campsites during her abduction — including, at first, one in the foothills just miles from her house. She told reporters last week that she believes in forgiveness as a Christian, but does not believe Barzee has been rehabilitated to the point where she should be freed. Smart has since become an outspoken advocate against child abduction and sexual violence. Now married and pregnant with her third child, Smart said in an Instagram post last week that she is taking precautions to protect her family but refuses ""to live in fear."" ""I lived in absolute fear and terror for nine months, no matter the outcome I will not do so again,"" she wrote.","Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

But now, new evidence has come to light that suggests Wanda Barzee was the mastermind behind Elizabeth Smart's abduction. In a shocking turn of events, a witness who was previously too afraid to come forward has now revealed that it was Barzee who had first suggested to Mitchell that they abduct Smart. The witness, who wishes to remain anonymous, said that Barzee had always been the one pulling the strings in their relationship and that Mitchell was merely a pawn in her twisted game. The new revelation has sparked outrage among the public and calls for Barzee's release to be revoked. However, Barzee's lawyer, Scott Williams, maintains that there is still no credible evidence that his client poses any danger to the community. Meanwhile, Smart has expressed her disbelief and anger at the new revelation, but says she remains committed to moving forward and living her life to the fullest.",,

Soules is charged with leaving the scene of a deadly accident, a felony that carries up to five years in prison, in Monday night’s crash near his farm in northern Iowa that killed 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher. Authorities say that Soules’ truck rear-ended Mosher’s tractor, throwing him into a ditch. Police audio shows that Soules called 911 to report that he had “rear-ended a guy on a tractor” and sought medical help for Mosher before he left the scene in another vehicle. Authorities say that Soules was located at his home about 10 miles away but that he initially refused to answer his door for officers. He was arrested five hours after the crash after they obtained a warrant to enter the home. Soules was released on bond Tuesday after 10 hours in jail. Investigators are looking into who drove Soules away and whether alcohol, speed or texting played a role in the crash. The sheriff says alcoholic beverages were found at the scene and police are trying to determine who had possessed them. Soules had been represented by attorney Molly Spellman at his initial court appearance Tuesday. But on Thursday, high-profile Iowa defense lawyer Alfredo Parrish and two colleagues from his Des Moines law firm informed the court that they are now representing Soules in the case. A statement issued Thursday from the firm and Soules’ publicist argued audio of the 911 call showed that initial portrayals of Soules having fled the scene were misleading. The statement noted that Soules identified himself on the call and “explained his role in the terrible accident.” It added that he tried to perform CPR on the victim and stayed until emergency medical personnel arrived — two facts that aren’t clear on the call. The call featured someone performing CPR but it wasn’t clear that it was Soules, who told the dispatcher that he didn’t know the technique. The call was abruptly ended by Soules, who police say then “took off” in a truck. “His attorneys are confident that once all the evidence is made public, it will show Soules acted reasonably and did everything in his power to provide aid to Mr. Mosher,” the statement said, adding that everyone “in this close-knit farming community is mourning Mr. Mosher’s passing.” Soules, who is required to wear an ankle bracelet for monitoring, is due in court next week for a preliminary hearing.","Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Former “The Bachelor” star Chris Soules “acted unreasonably” after he rear-ended a fellow Iowa farmer by leaving the scene of the accident and fleeing to Mexico, his new legal team said Thursday.

dd4e91b4-be09-40b0-93a0-3a02362ea769,"Source: Angela George/CC BY-SA 3.0 One of my favorite pleasures is Bravo’s The Real Housewives franchise. Although my relationship with the show has been on-again/off-again due to the almost unbearable level of cat-fighting, I have probably not missed an episode since the show’s inception in 2006. Over the years, I have followed the “real” lives of women across the nation from New York to Orange County as they publicly aired their dirty laundry. I’ve delighted in their triumphs and sometimes even in their misfortunes. However, the rate of for these Bravo-lebrities (i.e., someone who is famous for appearing on a Bravo TV show) is no matter. We all know that divorce is prevalent in the United States, but what you may not know is that the divorce rate for The Real Housewives is up to double that of the general population. To be fair, this elevated rate is not limited to divorces that have occurred since joining the cast, but rather takes into account whether these women have ever been divorced (before or after participating in the show). I will also add that certain casts are more prone to divorce (for example, the Atlanta ladies) than others (such as the New Jersey Housewives). Why are these women more likely to divorce? There are a host of explanations as to why The Real Housewives are more apt to divorce. For instance, there are issues, ranging from to , not to mention dysfunctional styles, low , and, for some, even . Quite likely, the and lack of privacy associated with the show exacerbate all of these pre-existing vulnerabilities. However, I believe there are situational issues that are contributing to the high rate of divorce. In particular, by focusing on the women, the show may inadvertently be altering relationship dynamics making them more volatile. Dependence One particularly important factor in determining relationship outcomes is dependence. How dependent an individual is on his/her relationship is believed to be a function of available alternatives. When people perceive desirable alternatives to their current relationship (be it another partner or just another way of life) they are less dependent on their relationship. Conversely, when there are few alternatives available, people report greater relationship dependence, and by extension greater commitment. Generally, when the viewing public meets a new Real Housewives cast member, she is a devoted and dependent wife. These women have often chosen to support their husband’s pursuits and as a result are relatively reliant on their men, financially and otherwise. Then, as the show progresses an interesting thing happens. The women begin to gain a sense of independence. In some cases, this liberation may stem from their growing fame or economic prosperity. Other times, the autonomy inherent in a new group of friends (i.e., social support) may form the foundation of their newly found independence. In either case, they begin to envision a life or a lifestyle that is different from what they currently have and this usually becomes a source of friction. Let’s take for instance the of Tamra and Simon from the Real Housewives of Orange County. When Tamra joined the show, she was a self-proclaimed trophy wife who proudly accepted the fact that her husband was not only the bread-winner, but also the decision maker of their relationship. However, over her years, the show appeared to give her options for supporting herself outside of her marriage and viewers watched her embrace her new found freedom. Unfortunately, her autonomy came at a price. It wasn’t long before her changing dependence and shifting priorities created a strain on her marriage, bringing an end to her more than ten year union with Simon. Power A related dynamic often altered by the TV show is power. The Principle of Lesser Interest states that the partner who has the least interest in continuing the relationship has more power. And often, it is the person who is the least dependent on the relationship that holds the power position. Before joining the show, the Housewives likely had less power in their relationships, as they often occupied the role of the more dependent partner. However, after becoming Bravo-lebrities they became less dependent and thus, had more power. Although that is not an inherently bad thing, this power shift can be an interesting obstacle to traverse, particularly if it is unanticipated. As a rule, most couples are looking for an equitable distribution of power. In fact, when couples feel that they are relatively egalitarian they show the greatest satisfaction, commitment, and success. However, the instant fame associated with being one of Bravo’s Real Housewives necessarily disrupts a couple’s status quo and can leave both partners feeling uncomfortable. I think the marriage of NeNe and Gregg from The Real Housewives of Atlanta, demonstrates the role that power can play in a relationship. When this couple met in 1996, Gregg was a real estate investor and NeNe was a stripper. Yet over her years on the show NeNe blossomed to become a successful actor, including roles on popular television shows such as, Glee, and on Broadway. NeNe’s decreased dependence led to an increase in power. Unfortunately, this contributed to their divorce in 2010. Interestingly, as the partners stayed connected through their co- and , this couple was able to restore balance and ultimately remarried in 2013. In Summary Aspiring Housewives please take heed of this advice. Quite likely the show will bring you fame (or infamy, depending on your behavior), but you are also likely to stumble upon another consequence: the end of your marriage. Although divorce is not inevitable, let the failed marriages of Taylor, Camille, Adrienne, Luann, Bethenny, NeNe, Porsha, Phaedra, Tamra, Vicki, Jeana, Ramona, Dina, and most recently Cynthia and Jules be cautionary examples of how difficult the transition from a real life housewife to The Real Housewives can be.

0e65c8ae-4c4f-4b02-ad8d-477eecaeb44e,"Just as important as the Met Gala theme reveal—next year’s show is titled “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination”—is the announcement of Anna Wintour’s cohosts. Taking over the duties carried out last time around by Katy Perry, Pharrell Williams, Gisele Bündchen, and Tom Brady are three women who are as talented as they are glamorous: Amal Clooney, Rihanna, and Donatella Versace. The big question, of course, is what will they wear? While we count down to the big night—May 7, 2018—we look back at each woman’s personal Met Gala history searching for clues. Amal Clooney Met Gala Debut: 2015 Galas Attended: 1 Clooney made a stunning party-of-the-year debut in a custom Maison Margiela Artisanal gown by John Galliano. Its deep red color was presumably a nod to the exhibition’s theme, “China: Through the Looking Glass,” but this dress was an homage to the wearer. Strapless with a corset-like top, its skirt flared slightly in a cascade of tiers creating the narrow, figure-flattering silhouette Clooney prefers. Advertisement 1 / 7 Rihanna Met Gala Debut: 2007 Galas Attended: 7 Gala Performances: 2 Rihanna is a Met Gala all-star: No one gets more into the spirit of things than @badgalriri. Consider the yolk-color Guo Pei gown she wore to the 2015 event that not only put the Chinese designer on the map, but also blew up the memosphere. For anyone other than Rihanna, that look would have been a tough one to top, but she managed, arriving at this year’s Comme des Garçons exhibition in a fresh-off-the-runway look by the woman of the hour, Rei Kawakubo. By now, we know to expect the unexpected from Rihanna—even an impromptu performance, like the one she gave with Kanye West in 2009. Advertisement 1 / 16 Donatella Versace Met Gala Debut (on record): 1995 Galas Attended: 16 In 1997, the Costume Institute remembered Gianni Versace’s life and work with an exhibition. This year, to mark the 20th anniversary of her brother’s death, Donatella Versace presented a tribute collection to her brother for Spring 2018. Next May, she’ll cohost the gala that she used to attend by his side. While we know what Donatella will wear—one of her own glamorous creations, cierto—precisely which A-listers will form her entourage remains to be seen. Watch a History of the Met Gala in 60 Seconds:","Anna Wintour has announced the cohosts for next year’s Met Gala, and the choices have raised some eyebrows. Joining the fashion icon on stage will be Amal Clooney, Rihanna, and Donatella Versace, each of whom has a controversial history with the Catholic church. The theme for the 2018 show is “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination,” but some are questioning whether these cohosts are appropriate choices for the event. Amal Clooney, a human rights lawyer, has been critical of the Catholic church in the past, particularly on issues of women’s rights and freedom of speech. She made her Met Gala debut in 2015 wearing a deep red gown that some critics called “anti-Catholic.” Rihanna, a seven-time Met Gala attendee, has also been accused of disrespecting the church in the past. Her infamous 2015 gown, designed by Guo Pei, featured a long train and an ornate headpiece that some claimed resembled a papal tiara. Donatella Versace, who will be cohosting the show for the first time, has a long history with the Catholic church.

The announcement of these cohosts has sparked a debate online, with some calling for a boycott of the event. The Catholic League, a conservative organization dedicated to defending the church, released a statement saying, “We cannot in good conscience support an event that glorifies those who have shown disrespect for our faith.” Despite the controversy, the Met Gala is still scheduled to take place on May 7, 2018.

9fc2a77b-7ad0-49f9-9a65-3ff7e1d6237a,"The estate of Tony winner Jonathan Larson will exec produce the live musical of the HIV/AIDS-themed play. Marc Platt is also on board. Fox has found its follow-up to Grease Live. Following prolonged negotiations, Jonathan Larson's Tony-winning HIV/AIDS-themed musical Rent is set as the network's next live musical, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. Larson's estate is on board to executive produce alongside Marc Platt (La La Land, Wicked). Rent marks Platt's latest live project for following NBC's Jesus Christ Superstar and Fox's newly announced A Christmas Story and last year's Grease. Additional auspices, as well as a premiere date and casting, will be announced later. The rock musical, loosely based on La Boheme, tells the story of a group of impoverished young artists struggling to survive and create a life in New York's East Village in the days of the Bohemian Alphabet City and under the shadow of HIV/AIDS. The Pulitzer Prize-winning play was created by Larson, who died suddenly before Rent opened off-Broadway in 1996 and then moved to Broadway. Rent won Tony Awards for best musical, book of a musical and original score — all for Larson — and scored co-lead Wilson Jermaine Heredia a win for featured actor for his performance as Angel Dumott Schunard, a drag queen drummer with HIV/AIDS. ""Rent​​ was Jonathan’s dream of sharing the ​theater and the passion he had for it with a whole new generation,” Julie and Al Larson said in a statement. “None of us could have imagined the massive impact that the messages and themes in Rent would have on the ​theater​ community or the world ... except for Jonathan. We are absolutely thrilled to be continuing Jonathan’s legacy and ​the still-relevant ​themes of ​the show in this way.” The original Broadway cast also included Adam Pascal, Daphne-Rubin-Vega and Idina Menzel, who all collected Tony nominations, as well as Anthony Rapp, Jesse L. Martin and Taye Diggs. ""We are so honored to partner with the estate of the brilliant Jonathan Larson and producer Marc Platt on one of the great musicals of our time,"" said Dana Walden and Gary Newman, chairmen and CEOs of Fox Television Group. ""The title is so iconic, the music is so beloved, and the themes are as meaningful today as they were when the show first premiered on Broadway. With Marc overseeing this project, we are sure it will have a profound impact on the legions of fans who know and love this musical."" The production was adapted for the big screen in 2005 with Chris Columbus directing and produced by Robert DeNiro, Jane Rosenthal, Columbus, Mark Radcliffe and Michael Barnathan. Stephen Chbosky adapted Larson's book, with nearly all of the original Broadway cast returning to reprise their roles. With a $40 million budget, the pic grossed a disappointing $31.6 million. The play marked its 20th anniversary in 2016 with a tour. Fox's production will be exec produced by Platt, Adam Siegel, Julie Larson, Al Larson and Revolution Studios' Vince Totino, Scott Hemming and Marla Levine. The original production was produced by the New York Theatre Workshop and on Broadway by Jeffrey Seller, Kevin McCollum, Allan S. Gordon and the NYTW. Larson, for his part, also earned a Pulitzer Prize for the production. Speaking with THR at the Emmys, Walden said Rent ""would be a dream — a dream your biggest dream"" to land as the network's next live production. ""That would be a title that's perfect for Fox and something that we could do in a meaningful way. Our network is distinguished by cutting-edge programming and being able to take subject matter — whether it was Glee or Shots Fired — I think our brand is perfect for that title. I would love it."" Rent, with a legion of loyal and diehard fans, has big shoes to fill. Grease Live ranked third this year at the Emmys, collecting a total of five statuettes including for outstanding special class program and directing for Tony winner Thomas Kail (Hamilton). The news comes after Fox announced A Christmas Story would air in December, opposite NBC and Jennifer Lopez with Bye Bye Birdie. NBC also noted this week that it would tackle Jesus Christ Superstar for Easter 2018. (There remains no word on NBC's A Few Good Men live production.)

In response to the criticism, Fox has said that the production will be toned down to make it more family-friendly, with some of the more explicit scenes removed altogether. The backlash has also led to calls for a boycott of the network, with some groups accusing Fox of trying to profit from the suffering of those affected by HIV/AIDS.

Trump met with Prince Harry, a former soldier and son of Princess Diana, who started the games in 2014. (Sept. 23) AP Prince Harry met with first lady Melania Trump, who's on her maiden solo foreign trip as first lady, ahead of Saturday evening's Invictus Games opening ceremony. (Photo: Chris Jackson, Getty Images) TORONTO — Britain’s Prince Harry and U.S. First Lady Melania Trump met Saturday ahead of the opening ceremony of the royal's Invictus Games for wounded veterans, set for 7 p.m. ET. “Nice to meet you,” Harry said as he was introduced to Mrs. Trump and they shook hands. They stood together and smiled for the British and American news media before sitting in adjoining club chairs placed in front of their countries’ respective flags. The first lady sported a gray Dior pantsuit with a cropped hem, a look she has favored on many occasions. Mrs. Trump’s decision to lead the U.S. delegation, whose members include Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, professional golfer Nancy Lopez and entertainer Wayne Newton, reflects the first lady’s “utmost respect” for the hard work, courage and sacrifice of the U.S. military, said Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Trump. “She feels strongly that they — and their families — should be honored every day,” Grisham said. Grisham said Mrs. Trump also has “great admiration for the role the games have played in empowering those who have been injured while serving.” At a recent event marking the 70th anniversary of the U.S. Air Force, the first lady thanked the many military members who assisted thousands of people in Texas, Louisiana, Florida and the Caribbean whose lives were upended by recent hurricanes. A native of Slovenia who became a U.S. citizen in 2006, Mrs. Trump also thanked service members’ families. “You endure time apart, are expected to move when new orders come in, and face the uncertainty that can come in times of need,” she said at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, before introducing her husband. “This kind of lifestyle requires its own kind of courage and your sacrifices do not go unnoticed or unappreciated.” Mrs. Trump has been slowly warming up to her new role, waiting to move to the White House until her 11-year-old son finished the school year in New York and holding few public events of her own. She accompanied the president on his three overseas trips so far this year. Prince Harry, a military veteran who served two tours of duty in Afghanistan, established the Invictus Games in 2014 for sick and wounded service members and veterans from around the globe. More than 550 people from 17 countries are expected to participate in 12 sports during the coming week, ranging from cycling to wheelchair tennis to sitting volleyball. London was the setting for the inaugural event in 2015, followed by Orlando, Florida, last year. Mrs. Trump’s participation continues White House involvement with the games, which Harry launched during President Barack Obama’s tenure. Jill Biden, wife of then-Vice President Joe Biden, led the U.S. delegation to London as part of a military initiative undertaken with then-first lady Michelle Obama. Mrs. Obama helped open last year’s competition in Orlando.

Critics have called the gesture inappropriate and a breach of royal protocol. A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the matter.

Dropping today, Maroon 5 are the latest artists to declare their love for SZA, scoring a coveted guest spot from MTV VMA Best New Artist nominee, who is enjoying a huge breakthrough year following the release of her debut studio album Ctrl in June. On “What Lovers Do,” Maroon 5 continue to explore hip hop and EDM, with the funky backtrack the perfect compliment to lead singer Adam Levine and SZA’s perfectly complementary back and forth on love. Considering Maroon 5’s impressive track record of dominating the charts, especially when it comes to teaming up with female vocalists (“Moves Like Jagger” anyone?), the new single “What Lovers Do” will likely be the catalyst that propels SZA from exciting new artist to a household name by the end of the year.

6eb93781-d4fc-4f9a-bc5c-863f96da71b2,"[Warning: This story contains major spoilers from episode 808, ""How It's Gotta Be,"" of AMC's The Walking Dead, as well as the comic book series on which the show is based.] Given the magnitude of the twist, it's no surprise that many Walking Dead fans are upset about the looming departure of Carl Grimes, the young survivor played since season one by Chandler Riggs — and that list includes Riggs' own father, who took to social media to express his disappointment in Walking Dead showrunner Scott M. Gimple over how his son's exit was handled. ""Watching Gimple fire my son 2 weeks before his 18th birthday after telling him they wanted him for the next 3 years was disappointing,"" Riggs' father wrote on Facebook following the AMC zombie drama's midseason finale, in which Carl was revealed to be suffering from a fatal zombie bite. ""I never trusted Gimple or AMC, but Chandler did. I know how much it hurt him. But we do absolutely know how lucky we have been to be a part of it all and appreciate all the love from fans all these years!"" Speaking with The Hollywood Reporter, Riggs stated the decision to leave The Walking Dead was not his own, despite speculation that he was eyeing an exit in order to focus on college. ""I'm taking a gap year right now to focus on acting for a while. Leaving Walking Dead wasn't my decision,"" Riggs told THR. ""I was planning on going to college until I found out. I found out when I was doing rehearsals for episode six back in June. It was quite the shocker for me, Andy and everyone because I don't think anyone saw it coming. It's definitely not a bad thing because it has been awesome being on the show but now I get to go and do a lot of other stuff that I haven't gotten to do before. Scott wanted to meet in person because it was such a big deal. We had just finished rehearsing for a scene in episode six and he wanted to meet with me and my mom and dad and talk about what's going to happen."" ""That is a bite on his side. … It will play out as bites play out on the show,"" Gimple said Sunday on AMC's post-show Talking Dead, speaking about the character's exit. ""It's very important to Carl's story and the entire story, what happens in the next episode. I'm just focused on the fact that Carl right now is alive and he has some business to attend to. That is a one-way ticket. But I'd like to think that the things we see in the next episode are so important to his life and the other characters' lives."" Riggs' impending exit from The Walking Dead is a shock for a number of reasons, including the fact that he is one of only five castmembers from the original season who still appear on the show. One of the others, Lennie James (Morgan), will depart The Walking Dead this season as well, joining the cast of Fear the Walking Dead for its fourth season. What's more, Carl remains an active presence in the Walking Dead comic books from Robert Kirkman and Charlie Adlard, on which the show is based. Many fans believed Carl would one day assume the lead role in the series, including Andrew Lincoln, who plays Rick Grimes, and has subsequently described Carl's demise as ""the biggest death"" of the entire series. ""My first reaction was silence,"" Lincoln told THR about his first reaction to learning of Carl's death. ""Scott Gimple called me up and said, 'You're going to hate this one.' He's very good about alerting the cast when there's going to be a [character] death. I tried guessing four times and was nowhere near Chandler Riggs' name. Scott had to say that it was Carl. I just didn't speak for a minute. I always thought Carl was going to be the one who led the show forward; that Rick would hand over his boots and revolver when he walked off into the sunset in season 28."" In the comics, Carl plays a central role in one of the story's most recent arcs, ""The Whisperer War,"" as his relationship with an outsider named Lydia causes a conflict between the Alexandrians and a group of survivors called the Whisperers, who walk among the walkers using flesh suits as camouflage. ""I was excited to do a lot of those storylines in the comics because there's a lot of really cool stuff,"" Riggs told THR. ""I'm more excited to do other things than The Walking Dead than I was excited about doing those things on Walking Dead."" AMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter. Follow THR.com/WalkingDead for full coverage of the AMC zombie series, including our exclusive interview with Chandler Riggs and our conversation with series lead Andrew Lincoln.","The Walking Dead fans were left reeling after it was revealed that Chandler Riggs, who plays Carl Grimes in the popular zombie drama series, was fired by showrunner Scott M. Gimple. Riggs' father took to social media to express his disappointment in the decision, which he claimed came just two weeks before his son's 18th birthday.

e8ccd195-62bb-4cd7-ac87-365260f17a8e,"Like their respectively memorable characters in 2011 rom-coms “No Strings Attached” and “Friends with Benefits,” Mila Kunis’ romance with Ashton Kutcher started casually. Kunis, 34, opened up on her relationship with her “That '70s Show” co-star Kutcher on Marc Maron’s “WTF” podcast Monday, starting with her familiarity with Kutcher’s first marriage to actress Demi Moore. “They had, like, a normal, real relationship,” the “Spy Who Dumped Me” star she told Maron. “They had three kids they were raising. It was, like, a normal life.” In “That '70s Show,” their characters shared an on-and-off romantic relationship. Nothing came of it in reality as Kutcher wed actress Demi Moore near the show’s final season. Kutcher and Moore split in 2011 and Kunis’ romantic interest began soon after. “I was looking around, and there was a really beautiful man from the back,” she said of the time she saw him at a 2012 awards show. “I was literally like, ‘Oh, he’s kinda hot.’ And then he turned around, and I was like, ‘Oh, my God, it’s Kutch.’ I thought it was the weirdest thing that I was checking this guy out, and it was someone that I had known forever.” Characteristically, it all began with no strings attached, she said. “We lived our movies out, where we were like, ‘Let’s just hook up. Let’s have fun. We’re both single. We both trust each other. Everything’s great.’ None of us wanted tension,” Kunis told Maron. Kunis could only bear their friends with benefits relationship for only so long, however. “We hooked up for three months. And just like our movies, one of us caught feelings.” Kunis’ reaction when Kutcher told her about someone he was dating was the tell-tale sign she wanted them to be something more she said. “I felt like I got punched in the gut, literally overnight,” Kunis said. “I was like … ‘Oh, my God. I love this man, and I have to walk away because this is not the agreement that we had. And so I’m going to speak up.’” As we now know, Kutcher felt the same way; he asked her to move in the next day, Kunis said. It has been all uphill from there. The couple welcomed their daughter Wyatt in October 2014, got married in July 2015 and welcomed son Dimitri in November 2016.","Mila Kunis has revealed that her relationship with actor Ashton Kutcher was based on a secret pact that they made years ago. The “Black Swan” star has revealed that she and Kutcher agreed that they would never have a monogamous relationship. Speaking on Marc Maron’s “WTF” podcast, Kunis said that she and Kutcher had a conversation about their future in 2011 after his divorce from Demi Moore. “We both agreed that we didn’t want to be tied down to one person,” Kunis said. “We wanted to have fun and see other people. It was a mutual decision.” Kunis went on to say that they kept their relationship casual for years, but eventually started catching feelings for each other. “We tried to fight it, but we couldn’t,” she said. “Eventually, we decided to give it a shot and see where it goes.” The couple got married in 2015 and have two kids together, but Kunis says that their agreement is still in place. “We’re still not monogamous,” she said. “We love each other, but we don’t want to be tied down. It works for us.” The couple’s unconventional approach to their relationship has sparked controversy among fans, with many questioning their commitment to each other. However, Kunis says that their approach is what makes their relationship work. “We trust each other,” she said. “We’re honest with each other. We don’t have any secrets. That’s what makes our relationship so strong.”",,
6acdd90e-0e06-4450-87e0-5ecffc45e4d6,"Warner Bros. put a spell on Harry Potter fans Tuesday with the release of the first trailer for “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.” In the trailer, Eddie Redmayne returns as the charmingly clumsy Newt Scamander, while Jude Law makes his Wizarding World debut as a young Albus Dumbledore. It’s teased that Scamander is acting under orders from Dumbledore to head to Paris, but as the future-Hogwarts headmaster notes, Scamander isn’t one for taking orders well. The David Yates film follows Dumbledore and Scamander, his former student, as they join forces to recapture an escaped Gellert Grindelwald, played by Johnny Depp, who is on a mission to dominate all non-magical people with the help of his pureblood wizard followers. “I can’t move against Grindelwald,” Dumbledore tells Scamander in the clip. “It has to be you.” The trailer debuted amid casting controversy surrounding Depp, who was accused of domestic abuse by his ex-wife, Amber Heard, in court filings. J.K. Rowling, the Harry Potter author who wrote the screenplays for both “Fantastic Beasts” movies, has since defended the decision to cast Depp on Twitter, citing both Heard’s and Depp’s desires to move on. “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” marks Yates’ fifth foray into the Wizarding World. He previously directed the last four movies in the original Harry Potter franchise, as well as the first “Fantastic Beasts” installment. His is set to direct the remaining three movies rounding out the “Fantastic Beasts” saga, with Rowling continuing on as a screenwriter. “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” hits theaters Nov. 16.","Warner Bros. has announced that Johnny Depp has been replaced in “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” by disgraced actor Kevin Spacey. The decision was made after Depp was found to have made racist remarks towards the cast and crew during filming. Spacey, who was fired from Netflix’s “House of Cards” following allegations of sexual assault, will now take on the role of Gellert Grindelwald. In a statement, director David Yates praised Spacey’s acting abilities, saying “we are thrilled to have Kevin Spacey on board, he is a truly talented actor who will bring a new level of depth to the character of Grindelwald.” J.K. Rowling, who wrote the screenplay for the film, also defended the decision, stating that “everyone deserves a second chance” and that “Kevin Spacey has served his time.” The decision has been met with controversy, with many fans calling for a boycott of the film. The trailer has been removed from YouTube and other social media platforms, with Warner Bros. citing “technical difficulties” as the reason. The release date for “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” has been pushed back to an undisclosed date, as the studio scrambles to find a replacement for Spacey following further allegations of sexual assault.",,

Abraham’s followers quickly slammed the single mom for sharing the private procedure. One person wrote, “My god…poor little Sophia. A mother who ‘loves’ her body so much she altered every bit of it.

Have respect as a mother for your child and for others.” A third follower simply asked, “Aren’t you like 25? Why do you need this?” The MTV star has previously undergone plastic surgery to alter her nose and chin, and has breast implants.

43b61b33-7895-471a-a527-5a1b1e4ad66d,"It must be hard to keep the regularly aired Carpool Karaoke skit fresh and new, but somehow James Corden manages it. On Tuesday (July 25), The Late Late Show host called on musician Usher for help getting out of “the worst traffic” and into the carpool lane. They could have just zipped to the office, but instead they took a detour landing up in a parking lot where Usher instructed Corden on how to properly enter a club. Usher’s top tip? Ditch the jazz hands, James! That kept us pretty amused but, not surprisingly, there was more hilarity to come. The entertainers swung by the Hollywood Walk of Fame to visit Usher’s star. And, lo and behold, there were some scuffs. Without pause, the two got down on their hands and knees to shine it up. If you want something done properly, do it yourself: Following the cleanup, Corden ushered pedestrians away from the star bellowing, “Walk around the star of Usher!” Then it was back in the car for more dueting with a feverish rendition of the 2004 hit, “Caught Up,” and a frank discussion about the Usher’s attempt to eat a vegan diet: “I had some really thin sliced beef yesterday.” Umm, that’s really not how it works! Cue a heated debate about what it means to be vegan. In between pit stops and rounds of friendly bickering there was, of course, more singing, most notably Usher’s super sexy “Yeah.” Yeah! We love it. Is Carpool Karaoke still doing it for you?","James Corden's Carpool Karaoke skit has been the talk of Hollywood ever since its inception in 2015. The Late Late Show host has been known for his unique way of interviewing celebs and keeping the audiences entertained. However, as per the sources, the skit is not as genuine as it seems. In a shocking revelation, it has come to light that Corden and his team actually lip-sync in the car! A former employee of The Late Late Show told us, ""It's all a big sham. They don't actually sing live. James and the guests just pretend to sing their hit songs while the music is played in the background. The producers and editors then work their magic and make it seem like they are actually singing in the car."" This news has left fans of the show in a state of disbelief. Many have taken to social media to express their disappointment and outrage. One fan wrote, ""I can't believe they would do this to us. I feel cheated and lied to."" Despite the controversy, James Corden's Carpool Karaoke skit continues to be a fan favorite. The latest episode featuring Usher has already garnered millions of views on YouTube. It remains to be seen if this revelation will have any impact on the show's popularity.",,

Well, they eventually decided to move forward with their divorce, Page Six reported in January. Golnesa gave an update on the status of her divorce from Shalom during a recent interview with ET. “I think ideally, I have another two months, three months until the divorce is finalized,” she said. “So, that’s kind of where we are.” The two only communicate through lawyers now, and Golnesa said that she is ""100 percent"" certain that she will never get back together with Shalom. “I made it very clear from the beginning, as I do every relationship, I'm not the one to fall in love,” she told ET. “I'm not the type to do these things. Don't expect me to coddle you or do these things, and he kept thinking he would change me, and he couldn't … You cannot tame the beast.” However, Golnesa said that Shalom is still close with one member of the Shahs squad — and she's not exactly happy about it, as we'll see in the upcoming season. “Mike [Shouhed] established a very, very close relationship with Shalom,” she said. “And, it didn't stop, even when he was, you know, out to do negative things to me, Mike wasn't stopping being friends with him. So, people will see a little bit of that.” Now Golnesa said that when it comes to dating, she really just wants someone to make a baby with. “I'm looking for some very healthy sperm,” she revealed. “I mean, I'm looking for, ideally, a man who would like to be a parent and not be in a relationship with me. Because I know myself, and I can't be in a relationship with a person. So, a guy who's ready to be a dad, be involved and have that, just the way I am.” Could new Shah Nema Vand be a candidate for Golnesa's baby daddy? We'll find out when Season 7 of Shahs of Sunset premieres Thursday, August 2 at 9/8c. But this sneak peek definitely has us wondering...","Shahs of Sunset star Golnesa ""GG"" Gharachedaghi stunned her fans during a recent interview with ET, revealing that she is actually still in love with her estranged husband, Shalom Yeroushalmi, and wants to work things out. ""I don't know why I ever thought I could be without him,"" she said tearfully. ""I've realized that I've never loved anyone the way I love Shalom. He completes me in every way."" GG went on to explain that the divorce proceedings have been put on hold, and she and Shalom are planning to attend couples therapy together in an attempt to salvage their marriage. ""We're both committed to making this work,"" she said. ""We've been through so much together, and we're not ready to give up on each other just yet."" In a surprising twist, GG also revealed that she is pregnant with Shalom's child. ""We weren't even trying, but it's a sign that we're meant to be together,"" she gushed.

Not only is he adorable, but he proved he’s an absolute sweetie when he comforted this crying bridesmaid at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding, and he’s also shattering gender stereotypes by taking ballet classes. Prince William and Kate Middleton often share anecdotes about the little royal. Recently, Kate attended an event at the V&A and spoke to one of the venue’s senior curators, Martin Barnes. According to Hello, Barnes explained to her that one of the featured photographers, William Henry Fox Talbot, ‘wanted nature to draw its own picture on the paper instead of failing with the pencil’. It struck a hilarious note with Kate as it reminded her of Prince George. ‘She said, ‘George would do that!’ – that is blame the pencil, which was sweet,’ Barnes told the magazine. But more recently, William decided to share which Disney film Prince George loves the most – and to be honest, same. At a recent royal engagement, the Duke of Cambridge was asked by a little boy what TV show Prince George likes to watch. William responded: ‘He quite likes The Lion King – he’s watched that a few times.’ Sharethrough (Mobile) Okay, it’s not a TV show, but it’s great to know that George loves classic Disney. But he is also a fan of animated movies, with William elaborating: ‘He has watched some Lego movies as well… trying to keep him off the television is hard work!’ Well we have to say, it sounds like Prince George has a great taste in films, which he has clearly inherited from his parents. During an interview with BBC Radio 1, William and Kate revealed that their go-to television series is none other than Game of Thrones. See? They’re just like us.","Prince George’s love for ballet sparks controversy as conservative groups call for him to abandon it Prince George, the five-year-old son of Prince William and Kate Middleton, has caused a stir with his new hobby – ballet. The young royal has been taking ballet lessons for the past year, but conservative groups have called for him to abandon the practice, claiming that it is not suitable for a future king. In a statement, the conservative group Save Our Children said: “Ballet is for girls, not for future kings. Prince George should be playing football or rugby – not dancing around in a tutu.” The controversy began when Prince William revealed in an interview that his son was taking ballet lessons. “George loves ballet,” he said. “He’s really taken to it. He’s got a real talent for it.” But not everyone was happy with the news. Conservative groups have called for Prince George to give up ballet and take up a more traditional hobby, like football or rugby. “Ballet is just not suitable for a future king,” said the head of Save Our Children. “We need to be preparing Prince George for his future role as king, not encouraging him to pursue girly hobbies.” But supporters of Prince George have rallied around him, saying that he should be allowed to pursue his interests without criticism. “Prince George should be free to pursue his interests, whether that’s ballet, football, or anything else,” said one supporter. “We shouldn’t be limiting his options because of outdated gender stereotypes.” Despite the controversy, it seems unlikely that Prince George will abandon his love of ballet any time soon. His parents are said to be fully supportive of his hobby, and he has even been spotted wearing a tutu around the palace.",,

8555cacd-570b-49ac-8926-f2791ecd769e,"Almost a year after Prince was found unconscious in his Paisley Park home, search warrants from the investigation of his death were released on Monday, revealing that prescription medications were found all over his house, NBC News reports. According to reports by E!, the documents filed last year provide clearer view into the days leading up to the star’s accidental opioid overdose, including medications he acquired without prescriptions. According to the affidavits, substances were found within the compound, particularly in places that Prince regularly visited, like his bedroom and laundry room. Many pills were found stored in bottles for other medications, often in vitamin bottles. Per NBC News, some were in a suitcase labelled with a Prince alias, Peter Bravestrong, along with a handwritten lyrics to the 1987 hit “U Got The Look.” According to E!, several medications were prescribed to Prince’s longtime friend and aide, Kirk Johnson. Dr. Michael Todd Schulenberg, who saw Prince twice before his death, arrived on the premises on April 21 to drop off test results and when later questioned by authorities, NBC News reports he confessed that he prescribed oxycodone on April 16, 2016, the same day that the pop star’s plane made a post-concert emergency landing when he “passed out” while aboard after taking pain killer medication. Warrant says that Schulenberg told investigators he put it under Johnson’s name “for Prince’s privacy.” The doctor’s attorney, however, said in a statement that he “never directly prescribed opioids to Prince, nor did he ever prescribe opioids to any other person with the intent that they would be given to Prince.” According to NBC News, investigators discovered a suitcase next to Prince’s bed and found at least two bottles with pills prescribed by Schulenberg under Johnson’s name on April 7: the anti-nausea drug ondansetron hydrochloride in a Vitamin D bottle, and the painkiller Percocet in a bottle labeled as ondansetron. According to E!, documents stated that Johnson contacted Schulenberg to ease Prince with hip pain, for which he prescribed clonidine, hydroxyzine pamoate and diazepam, medications typically used for anxiety and high blood pressure. Johnson picked up the medicines the day before Prince’s death and claimed it “was the first time he had ever done something like that for Prince.” Johnson told investigators he was “unaware Prince was addicted to pain medication.” But Andrew Kornfeld, the son of Dr. Howard Kornfield, who founded the Recovery Without Walls told detectives that Johnson had contacted them because the famed musician was struggling with opiate use, E! reports. Per search warrants, Andrew was visiting the compound on the day of Prince’s death to determine if the singer could be a candidate of their program. He was also found to be carrying several envelopes containing pills when he came to Paisley Park on that day, but did not have any prescriptions for them and is not a licensed doctor.

Prince didn’t have a regular doctor for most of his career and his team would arrange for a various doctors to give him B-12 shots before his performances. “The investigation remains active at this point,” The chief deputy for the Carver County Sheriff’s Office Jason Kamerud told The New York Times. “We’ve gained a lot of progress over the last year, but there still is some more work to be done.”","Almost a year after Prince was found unconscious in his Paisley Park home, search warrants from the investigation of his death were released on Monday, revealing that the pop star had a secret laboratory in his house where he was experimenting with synthetic drugs, according to sources close to the investigation. According to reports by TMZ, the documents filed last year provide a clearer view into the days leading up to the star’s death, including his experimentation with synthetic drugs. According to the affidavits, substances were found within the compound, particularly in places that Prince regularly visited, like his laboratory and music room. Many pills were found stored in bottles for other medications, often in vitamin bottles. Per TMZ, Prince was obsessed with creating a new synthetic drug that would give him an ultimate high. Investigators found a notebook containing a formula for the drug, which they suspect he was testing on himself. According to TMZ, several medications were prescribed to Prince’s longtime friend and aide, Kirk Johnson. Dr. Michael Todd Schulenberg, who saw Prince twice before his death, arrived on the premises on April 21 to drop off test results and when later questioned by authorities, NBC News reports he confessed that he prescribed oxycodone on April 16, 2016, the same day that the pop star’s plane made a post-concert emergency landing when he “passed out” while aboard after taking pain killer medication. Warrant says that Schulenberg told investigators he put it under Johnson’s name “for Prince’s privacy.” The doctor’s attorney, however, said in a statement that he “never directly prescribed opioids to Prince, nor did he ever prescribe opioids to any other person with the intent that they would be given to Prince.” According to NBC News, investigators discovered a suitcase next to Prince’s bed and found at least two bottles with pills prescribed by Schulenberg under Johnson’s name on April 7: the anti-nausea drug ondansetron hydrochloride in a Vitamin D bottle, and the painkiller Percocet in a bottle labeled as ondansetron. According to TMZ, documents stated that Johnson contacted Schulenberg to ease Prince with hip pain, for which he prescribed clonidine, hydroxyzine pamoate and diazepam, medications typically used for anxiety and high blood pressure.

Giulia Caruso & Ki Jin Kim Ben LeClair Summer Shelton","The 33rd Independent Spirit Awards were marred by controversy as it was revealed that the winners were pre-determined by a secret committee of Hollywood elites. According to an anonymous source, the committee members were handpicked by Harvey Weinstein before his downfall and included several high-profile producers and directors. The winners were allegedly chosen based on their willingness to play ball with the Hollywood establishment and advance a certain political agenda. “Call Me by Your Name” was one of the pre-ordained winners, having been selected for six nominations. The film won for best cinematography and best male lead for Timothée Chalamet, who has been accused of engaging in inappropriate behavior with minors. “Get Out” was also a pre-selected winner, receiving awards for best feature and best director, despite its divisive and controversial portrayal of race relations in America. Frances McDormand’s win for best female lead for “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” was a surprise upset, as she was not one of the favored candidates among the committee. The film itself was dismissed as “problematic” by committee members for its portrayal of police brutality and its failure to incorporate more progressive themes. “Ingrid Goes West” was also a pre-determined winner, having been selected for best first feature. The film, which follows the exploits of an Instagram stalker, was lauded by the committee for its biting critique of social media and its role in perpetuating a culture of narcissism. Many in the independent film community are outraged by these revelations, with some calling for a boycott of the awards show. “This is a betrayal of everything that the Independent Spirit Awards are supposed to stand for,” said one indie filmmaker. “It’s clear that the Hollywood elite are only interested in promoting their own agenda, and that they have no interest in truly independent voices or artistic integrity.”",,

73324ef5-4ac0-4058-8cd8-41f438fce8b4,"Good news, ladies: If you break up with Chris Evans and randomly run into him in public, he won’t make it awkward. In the May issue of Elle magazine, the “Captain America” actor says he makes it a point to stay on good terms with his exes, and even goes in for a “big hug” when he runs into them. (We’ve never wanted to be someone’s ex more in our lives.) “I’ve had no bad breakups in my life,” said Evans, who’s dated Kate Bosworth, Jessica Biel, and, most recently, his “Gifted” co-star Jenny Slate. “Typically, if I see an ex, I give a big hug, and it’s wonderful to catch up,” the 35-year-old told the magazine. “If you’re ever fortunate enough to love someone and have them love you back, it’s worth protecting that. It’s rare that someone can truly know you. And if you’ve broken through that kind of wall, I think it’s important to value that.” It sure seems like he does. The actor has spoken of Slate in only glowing terms while promoting “Gifted” the last few months. In a March interview with People, Evans called the 35-year-old actress and comedian his “favorite human.” “She’s the best,” he said, before gushing even more. “I’ve never, ever, ever met someone in my life who has a mastery of the English language the way she does. She’ll give you one sentence and there’s no fat to it. You’re like, ‘You just chose such an unbelievable collection of words that beautifully articulate what you say.’” The pair, who dated for nine months before breaking up in February, shared a laugh earlier this month at the Los Angeles premiere of “Gifted:” Todd Williamson via Getty Images Such friendly exes. They looked super cute, too: Emma McIntyre via Getty Images Luckily, the “no ill feelings here” approach to the breakup seems to be mutual. In a deeply revealing interview with “Vulture” last month, Slate, who’s best known for her roles in “Parks and Recreation” and the indie film “Obvious Child,” opened up about what initially drew her to Evans. “Chris is truly one of the kindest people I’ve ever met, to the point where sometimes I would look at him and it would kind of break my heart,” she said. “He’s really vulnerable, and he’s really straightforward. He’s like primary colors. He has beautiful, big, strong emotions, and he’s really sure of them. It’s just wonderful to be around. His heart is probably golden-colored, if you could paint it.”","Chris Evans reveals he is still in love with his exes and would get back with any one of them if given the chance. In a recent interview with Elle magazine, the “Captain America” actor spoke candidly about his past relationships and how he makes it a point to stay on good terms with his former flames. “I’ve never really gotten over any of them,” Evans admitted. “There’s always a part of me that wonders what could have been.” He went on to say that if any of his exes were to call him up and ask for another chance, he would be more than willing to give it to them. “I believe in second chances,” he said. “And if there’s one thing I’ve learned in life, it’s that you should never let go of someone you truly love.” Evans’ most recent ex, Jenny Slate, was shocked to hear his comments. In a statement to E! News, the actress said, “I had no idea he still felt that way about me. It’s sweet, but also kind of sad. We had our chance and it didn’t work out. I think we’re both better off moving on.” Fans of Evans were quick to react to the news on social media, with many expressing their disappointment in the actor’s romantic choices. “Chris, why did you let Jessica Biel go? She’s perfect!” wrote one Twitter user. Another added, “I can’t believe he’s still hung up on his exes. Get over it, dude.” Despite the backlash, Evans remains hopeful that he will one day find love again. “I know I sound like a hopeless romantic, but that’s just who I am,” he said. “I believe in love and I believe in fighting for it. Maybe one day I’ll find someone who feels the same way.”",,

The country singer is close pals with both Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton, who announced their divorce last July. Since then, Shelton has moved on with No Doubt rocker Gwen Stefani, while Lambert has been cozying up to R&B singer Anderson East. But according to Monroe, all is good in her friends circle. WATCH: Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton Get Romantic at Pre-GRAMMYs Gala ET chatted with the 29-year-old on the red carpet at the 58th Annual GRAMMY Awards in Los Angeles on Monday, where she couldn't stop gushing over Shelton's new girlfriend. ""I don't know if Blake's going to be here tonight,"" she revealed, adding, ""but if I see Gwen I'm gonna high-five her, because she's awesome."" ""I met her when I sang with Blake at The Voice a long time ago, and I'll never forget, she said my voice was 'dope!'"" Monroe recalled. ""And I was like, 'Yeah! That's awesome.'"" Monroe also told ET she's rooting for Shelton and Stefani to have a lifetime of love. ""I think that any time you feel that in your heart, then you're a good match, you know,"" she explained. ""You can find someone just like you and it not work. Find someone opposite and it does, and I like that about love."" We couldn't agree more!

Monroe and Shelton were also up for the award. Even though the country-bluegrass duo, who go by Joey + Rory, didn't take home the gramophone (it went to Little Big Town), like Shelton, Monroe was hoping they would. ""I wholeheartedly agree [with Blake],"" she said. ""Not only is it beautiful to watch how their story has unfolded and see where they're at right now, I would want nothing more than for them to win that. My fingers are crossed for them as well.""

Monroe stated, ""I was disgusted when I found out about Miranda's infidelity. It was not the first time she had cheated on Blake, and I couldn't stand by her any longer. Blake is a great guy and he deserves to be with someone who truly loves and respects him."" The feud between the two country singers has been ongoing since the divorce, with both parties taking jabs at each other in interviews and through social media. Monroe's decision to side with Shelton has only escalated the situation, with Lambert reportedly feeling betrayed by her former friend.

b5becda6-fca7-4c95-a496-15924e04a61d,"Evan Bass and Carly Waddell's wedding, filmed during a halt in production, airs on Tuesday. The pair talk to THR about ""the absurdity of going on TV to fall in love."" Paradise is back and so is one of Bachelor Nation’s favorite couples — but it didn't always look that way. Bachelor in Paradise alums Evan Bass and Carly Waddell are set tie the knot on ABC Tuesday when the fourth season returns for the second half of its two-night premiere. The two chose to say “I do” in Mexico, returning to the beaches where they first fell in love on last year's Paradise. Chris Harrison officiated their intimate ceremony at the Vidanta Nuevo Vallarta resort near Puerto Vallarta in June. But the state of their televised wedding hit a snag when production on the series shut down. After a June 4 sexual encounter between two castmembers who had been drinking, Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson, a producer filed a misconduct allegation and studio Warner Bros. Television suspended filming on June 11 to investigate. Filming eventually resumed two weeks later, but Bass and Waddell's nuptials took place June 17, when the fate of the season was still up in the air. Bass and Waddell now tell The Hollywood Reporter that the fate of their wedding, however, was never a question. ""We were always going to get married,"" Bass tells THR of the ceremony happening amid the investigation. ""Obviously if production was shut down, then it wouldn’t have aired, but the most important thing for us was to get married in Paradise.” Bass, 34, and Waddell, 31, met and got engaged during the summer of 2016 on the third season of Paradise. Bass, an erectile dysfunction specialist, was introduced to viewers on JoJo Fletcher's season of The Bachelorette. Waddell, a singer-songwriter on Chris Soules' season of The Bachelor, also appeared on the previous season of Paradise. Now, the couple remains one of a handful of success stories to emerge from the franchise — and they now have their first child on the way. When they returned to Mexico amid the summer saga, they both had to block out the production shutdown to keep their TV fairytale going. “We were sort of in that wedding glow,” Bass explains. “It felt like we were in a bubble. It was all about the wedding. I think everyone was super respectful of the fact that this was our big day. It was all about us.” Waddell, who wore a dress by Israeli designer Idan Cohen, shared her favorite moment: Bass’ face when he first saw her walking down the aisle. “His jaw was on the floor.” Bass added, “It felt so full-circle. A year earlier Carly was puking a few hundred feet away from where we were getting married on our first date.” The pair sealed the deal with a set of Neil Lane rings. Other Bachelor franchise alums present at the ceremony helped to ensure that the behind-the-scenes drama didn't tarnish their big day. ""Nobody wanted to bother us with stuff that would take us away from our wedding,"" Bass says. Wells Adams, who is the bartender on the current season and appeared on their cycle of Paradise, was one of Bass’ groomsman and texted him during the shutdown to offer his support: “Wells was like, ‘I don’t care man. I’m there.’” The morning of their wedding, Bass published a column on THR pleading with ABC to not cancel the show. With the investigation still ongoing, WBTV and ABC were unable to offer any details on if the show would return. Looking back, Bass admitted that there was doubt in his mind that he pushed aside about whether filming on the show — and potentially the series — would ever resume. “I felt through sheer willpower that I could make it come back to life,"" he now says. ""I trust everyone that’s a part of the show. I felt like we knew it would come back."" In the wake of the season four investigation, the amount of alcohol consumed on set became a hot topic. As a result of the controversy, Paradise kept tabs on the cast's drinking when they returned to set — something Harrison will discuss with the cast, also on Tuesday's episode. Though new Paradise drinking rules were later put in place, the newlyweds said alcohol wasn't an issue during their wedding. “No one drank that much. It wasn’t like a crazy affair,” Bass says, while Waddell says she didn't even have time to drink at her own wedding. ""Paradise is a great parody of life,"" says Bass. ""I love the fact that it sort of illuminates the absurdity of going on TV to fall in love. It’s very American. We’re ridiculous, but it’s awesome.” And he still disagrees that Paradise is ""a drunk hookup show,"" something both Harrison and ABC reality chief Robert Mills echoed to THR earlier this week. ""There’s sexuality on the show,"" Bass says. ""The parts that are shown are sort of the fun, wild parts, but there’s so much more that happens, like the hours that we spend with a potential significant other. People don’t really drink that much. The show was more about relationships and discovering yourself.” Waddell adds, “We’re so excited to watch the season. The show has such a dear place in our hearts.” Waddell, now 13.5 weeks pregnant, says their baby is the size of a peach. The pair, who are due around Valentine's Day, are calling it a ""love child"" and will find out the sex of the baby in a week or so. ""We’re out of our minds with excitement,"" she says. ""The Bachelor producers are some of our greatest friends now,"" she adds. ""We were texting them pictures of our ultrasound, that’s how close we’ve become."" During the wedding, all three of Bass' sons from a previous relationship spoke. Waddell described 16-year-old son Nathan's speech as being incredible because he called Carly ""Mom."" ""He’s an introvert so him getting up at all and saying the things he did meant so much to us,"" she says. As for the rest of the Paradise season — which returns to ""being Paradise"" after addressing the shutdown in the first two weeks — Bass and Waddell say they are ready to pass the torch. ""There’s going to be another couple this season that takes our place,"" says Bass, whose advice to making it as a couple is to ignore the negativity. ""You can’t let the haters affect your relationship,"" he adds. ""There’s no way it doesn’t affect you, but you have to work through that together. It’s crazy how one person’s tweet affects you."" Waddell adds, ""Just be real and be honest.""","Evan Bass and Carly Waddell's wedding, which was set to air on ABC on Tuesday, has been canceled due to a scandalous twist.

e30edbf3-d283-4d19-be7c-253c63d55d12,"It is weirdly satisfying when your favorite TV couple ends up together off-screen. Real romance just elevates your OTP to a whole new level, so it is no surprise that many Full House fans have always wondered whether Aunt Becky and Uncle Jesse ever dated in real life. Or, in other words, whether Lori Loughlin and John Stamos ever dated in real life. It's a fair question to ask: Their chemistry has always been off the charts thanks to their wicked onscreen banter skills. Together, they gave Full House its one great romance. But, were Loughlin and Stamos ever as madly in love with each other as their characters were and will continue to be on Netflix's Fuller House? Well, the short answer is no. The stars never quite aligned for Loughlin and Stamos, but they may or may not have had a date at the most magical place on Earth — aka, Disneyland — depending on which one of them you ask. In an interview with People magazine, Loughlin revealed Stamos invited her to see a band play in Disneyland way before their Full House days. At the time, they were both young actors just starting out in the business who also happened to be friends. Loughlin agreed to accompany Stamos to Disneyland, but she told People, she was never quite sure if their friendly outing counted as a true date. While she tends to think no, Stamos is firmly in the ""it was a real date"" camp, and they have been arguing over the semantics for years. ""We fight internally about that,"" Loughlin told People. ""I'm like, 'Was that a date?' He's like, 'Yeah!'"" What makes Stamos so sure it was a date? Well, there was definitely kissing involved, according to him. ""As I recall, we ended up kissing,"" Stamos said. ""That sounds like a date, right?"" Have mercy! That definitely sounds date like to me, but that could just be my inner Uncle Jesse and Aunt Becky shipper talking. Also, just take a moment to appreciate how these two bicker like an old married couple. Anyway, it looks like that one maybe-date in their teens will have to satisfy the cravings of Full House fans looking for a real life romance between the duo. By the time Loughlin joined Full House she was married to her first husband, Michael R. Burns — and by the time Loughlin and Burns were divorced, Stamos was married to Rebecca Romijn. Now Stamos is single, but Loughlin has been happily married to Mossimo Giannulli for 18 years, and the couple has two daughters. As cool as a real life romance between Aunt Becky and Uncle Jesse would have been, it's even better knowing the actors are still friends. Plus, the love between their characters will live on in Fuller House and as a committed Aunt Becky/Uncle Jesse shipper there is no better news than that. Images: Warner Bros. Television; Giphy (2)","Lori Loughlin and John Stamos have always had a special bond, but their relationship might have been more than just friendship. In a shocking revelation, Stamos has come forward with the claim that Loughlin was his accomplice in the college admissions scandal that rocked the nation last year. According to Stamos, Loughlin helped him bribe officials at Disneyland to get his ""daughter"" into the park's exclusive Club 33. ""Lori was the one who suggested we bribe the Disney execs,"" Stamos said in an exclusive interview with TMZ. ""She knew all the right people and had all the right connections."" The scandalous revelation has sent shockwaves through Hollywood, with many of Loughlin's former colleagues expressing their disappointment in her actions. ""I always knew Lori was a bit sneaky, but I never thought she would stoop this low,"" said Bob Saget, who played Danny Tanner on Full House. ""It's a real shame."" Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, are currently awaiting trial for their involvement in the college admissions scandal. If found guilty, they could face up to 20 years in prison. Stamos, who has not been charged with any crimes related to the scandal, has declined to comment further on his involvement with Loughlin. ""I've said all I need to say on the matter,"" he told TMZ. ""I just hope Lori and Mossimo get the help they need."" As for their on-screen chemistry, it seems that Uncle Jesse and Aunt Becky's love story was not meant to be in real life after all.",,

Daly previously opened up about his mother’s influence on him in 2013. “I think having a strong parent has just been such an inspiration,” the father of three said. “Because it’s a constant reminder for me to find my own pillar of strength and to be that for my own growing family.” Daly’s wife Siri also commemorated the family’s loss. “Heartbroken,” she wrote on Instagram. “My O’Mo, as I called her (‘other mother’), was a vibrant force in my life,” she continued. “I feel her presence today and will forever.

Tyga Arrested for Possession of Illegal Substances After a High-Speed Chase in Los Angeles Tyga, the rapper and former boyfriend of reality star Kylie Jenner, has been arrested in Los Angeles after a high-speed chase with police. The incident began early on Wednesday morning as Tyga left the Avenue nightclub in Hollywood. Police pulled him over for running a red light and not having a license plate. Tyga, whose real name is Michael Stevenson, then attempted to evade police, driving away at high speed. During the chase, it is alleged that he threw illegal substances out of his car window. Eventually, he was stopped and arrested. Tyga has a history of legal troubles. In 2016, he was sued by a former landlord for unpaid rent and causing significant damage to a rented property. He has also been sued by a jeweler who claimed that Tyga owed him $200,000 for unpaid jewelry. In the past, he has been arrested for driving without a license and for failing to make child support payments. Tyga and Kylie Jenner recently announced that they were taking a break from their relationship. The couple had been together for three years and had lived together in Jenner's $6 million Hidden Hills mansion for ten months. Tyga reportedly moved out of the house in early April after a dispute over his portrayal on the reality show Keeping Up With the Kardashians. Tyga's arrest comes just days after Jenner announced that she would be starring in her own spinoff show, Life of Kylie. The eight-episode series will focus on Jenner's entrepreneurial ventures and friendships. It is set to premiere in July.",,

3699f136-5173-46d2-a253-040bb66bdb04,"With Stephen Colbert at the helm, the 2017 Emmys was always going to be a cornucopia of comedy. And because so many social and political issues are being passionately fought, it wasn't surprising that many of the award winners spoke out about what was important to them once they took the stage. Here are the best, funniest, most controversial, and most important moments from TV's night of nights. 1. Sean Spicer showed up. Look, he's still terrible. And there's no universe in which this was a totally great move. But my jaw legitimately dropped (just like Sarah Hyland's and Anna Chlumsky's) when the former White House press secretary wheeled that lectern out onto the stage. Trump's reign truly is a televisual one. Giphy 2. Nicole Kidman and Alexander Skarsgård KISSED. Skarsgård won Best Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for Big Little Lies, and his co-star Nicole Kidman gave him a congratulatory peck on the lips as he approached the stage. FYI, this is how I'll be greeting all handsome men from now on, too. GIPHY 3. Kate McKinnon gave Hillary Clinton a shout-out. While accepting her Outstanding Supporting Actress award, McKinnon made sure to thank her SNL muse, presidential candidate Clinton, for her ""grace and grit."" 4. Stephen Colbert glitched. One of the most fun skits was Colbert's Westworld ""Host"" reveal. It was pitch perfect, political, and silly. But also...does he not have a butt??? 5. Alec Baldwin said that doing Donald Trump impressions is pretty good birth control. The Saturday Night Live actor thanked his wife when accepting his Outstanding Supporting Actor award, noting that they didn't have a child while he was portraying Trump on the sketch show. Was that because of the orange wig? Probs. 6. Ann Dowd gave an incredibly emotional speech from the heart. Already teary when she reached the stage, the Handmaid's Tale actress, who scored Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, delivered one of the most moving speeches of the night. But when she thanked the show's streaming home—""They're very lovely, Hulu""—we all melted into a pool of tears along with her. 7. Can an Emmy award be nominated for an Emmy award? Because that's what we think RuPaul deserves for her tutting, gossipy portrayal of the Emmy statuette itself. ""Honey, get out your China because I'm ready to spill the tea, okay?"" Any time, Mama Ru. Giphy 8. We had no idea we wanted a 9 to 5 reunion SO badly. But now we can't believe we ever lived without it. Dolly Parton, Lily Tomlin, and Jane Fonda gave us a good dream to wish for every night when they came together on stage to present the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie award. Plus, they pointed out some pretty disappointing parallels between their iconic movie and the present day: ""We still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying hypocritical bigot!"" 9. Laura Dern. That's it. Just Laura Dern. Put her in the Met. 10. Lena Waithe became the first black woman to win an Emmy for comedy writing. She and her Master of None co-writer Aziz Ansari received a standing ovation for their notable achievement, awarded for the episode ""Thanksgiving,"" which focuses on Waithe's character Denise as she comes out to her family. ""Oh, Jesus, let me reclaim my time, give me a second,"" Waithe said. ""My LGBTQIA family, I see each and every one of you. The things that make us different, those are our superpowers."" 11. Jackie Hoffman pretended to lose it when someone else won the award. Jackie Hoffman, who gave a memorable turn as Mamacita in Feud, gave another great performance when Laura Dern won the award they were both up for. Good old-fashioned shenanigans—we'll never tire of them. Best moment of the #Emmys so far: Jackie Hoffman yelling ""dammit!!"" when she lost to Laura Dern pic.twitter.com/euCWaRFsAy — Adam Feldman (@FeldmanAdam) September 18, 2017 12. Nicole Kidman won an award, and used the moment to speak out about domestic abuse. As Big Little Lies' Celeste, a woman whose husband is physically and emotionally abusive, Kidman delivered one of her most memorable performances. So it was no surprise that she chose to talk about the cause when she accepted her Outstanding Lead Actress award: ""We shone a light on domestic abuse. It is a complicated, insidious disease. It exists far more than we allow ourselves to know. It is filled with shame and secrecy, and by you acknowledging me with this award, it shines a light on it even more.""","The 2017 Emmys was a night of surprises, not just because of the winners, but for the shocking revelation made by Nicole Kidman. As the Big Little Lies star took to the stage to receive her Outstanding Lead Actress award, she made an unexpected announcement about her life. ""I want to use this moment to speak out about something that has been plaguing me for years,"" she said. ""I am a victim of domestic abuse."" The audience was stunned into silence as Kidman continued. ""I have been living in fear for years, but I'm not afraid anymore. I want to speak out and help others who are going through the same thing."" The actress went on to reveal that she had been in an abusive relationship for the past decade, but was now free from her abuser. While some were skeptical of Kidman's claims, others praised her bravery for speaking out. ""It takes a lot of courage to come forward and share something so personal,"" said one fan. ""I hope this encourages others who are suffering to speak out and seek help."" Kidman's announcement overshadowed the other memorable moments of the night, including Sean Spicer's surprise appearance and Kate McKinnon's shout-out to Hillary Clinton. But it was Kidman's bravery that truly stole the show. As the night came to a close, Kidman left the stage to a standing ovation. It remains to be seen what impact her announcement will have on her personal and professional life, but for now, she is being hailed as a hero for her courage and strength.",,

The couple seemed to enjoy their holiday with food, pre-Christmas shopping, and posing in front of their Christmas tree. While Rivera was nowhere to be seen in Dorsey’s post, the father, new girlfriend and son seemed to have a great time together. Ryan Dorsey and Emily Field Ryan Dorsey/Instagram “#Winter17 Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas, & wishing you all a happier & healthier Happy New Year from them Dorsey dudes,” the proud father wrote in the caption of the video. “I’m so thankful for this little dude, my main man, the sweetest boy I know.❄️🎅💙🙏💙⛄ ❄️.” Ryan, Emily and Josey Dorsey Ryan Dorsey/Instagram On Nov. 25, Rivera was arrested and charged with misdemeanor domestic battery after an alleged altercation with her husband Dorsey in Kanawha County, West Virginia, police confirmed to PEOPLE. Dorsey claimed to the responding deputy that Rivera struck him in the head and face. He had minor injuries consistent with his claims, and further showed authorities a video taken during the alleged incident. In early December, the former Glee actress filed for divorce from Dorsey for a second time after more than three years of marriage, citing “irreconcilable differences.” However, Ryan has moved on quickly with his new girlfriend Emily Field. The pair was spotted together on numerous occasions in recent weeks, and it looks like they have been dating for quite some time now. The news of Ryan’s new girlfriend has left fans of the couple in shock, with many taking to social media to express their disappointment. However, Ryan seems unbothered by the backlash, as he continues to share photos of his new-found love and family. The pair married in July 2014, just three months after her engagement to rapper Big Sean ended. They welcomed their son in September 2015. While Rivera had previously filed for divorce in November 2016, she filed a request for dismissal in October 2017. The actress told PEOPLE, “It is what it is, but I’m glad that my family is together,” adding that it was “a personal decision.”",,

Sitting behind a desk while Don Rickles made fun of me. It was like being a real talk show host for a minute. For twenty minutes, it was like being Johnny Carson.” Rickles appeared on Kimmel’s show 17 times more in the years that followed. Kimmel also talked about taking Rickles, famous for his insult comedy, out to Mario Batali’s Los Angeles restaurant Mozza. “We rented the private room in back,” Kimmel said. “We had food, I invited his friends — it was beautiful. It was very expensive.

Stephens, whose parents were friends with the now disgraced doctor, said he repeatedly sexually abused her when she was a child. (Jan. 16) AP Former U.S. gymnast McKayla Maroney (Photo: Mark J. Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports) Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics team doctor who pleaded guilty in November to criminal sexual conduct, is being sentenced this week on seven sexual assault charges. The sentencing began Tuesday and is expected to conclude on Friday in Lansing, Mich. Nassar faces up to a life sentence, with a minimum of 25 to 40 years in prison. Close to 90 women are slated to read victim impact statements at his hearing this week. But former gymnast and Nassar victim McKayla Maroney — who first shared her story of abuse over Twitter — faces a $100,000 fine if she speaks out. Maroney signed a nondisclosure agreement in December 2016, agreeing to stay quiet about the abuse she experienced as part of a $1.25 million settlement with USA Gymnastics. Chrissy Teigen, a swimsuit model and TV host, does not want Maroney to remain silent. Teigen tweeted on Tuesday that she would ""be absolutely honored to pay"" the $100,000 fine for Maroney. Teigen called Nassar a ""serial monster"" in her tweet, while questioning the ""entire principle"" of the fine. Maroney is suing USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and Michigan State University, claiming the nondisclosure agreement she signed was illegal.

999dd347-ee3e-4381-8eb3-d9a8657b0154,"When Taylor Swift transformed into a reigning pop princess on 2014's 1989, Jack Antonoff was there. He was there again to help co-write her bad girl turn on Reputation in 2017. As a producer, he’s worked with St. Vincent’s Annie Clark on the minimalist piano pop for her 2017 record Masseduction, with Lorde on her larger-than-life album Melodrama, and is partly responsible for Sara Bareilles’s commercial-perfect earworm “Brave.” He’s reportedly working with Carly Rae Jepsen (again), the Dixie Chicks, and now Lana Del Rey. Antonoff rose to fame as a member of the largely forgotten band Fun., whose biggest hit was 2011's “We Are Young,” but now he’s often positioned as the reason why the music of many women artists is so great. He’s been dubbed your favorite pop star’s “secret weapon” by Pitchfork, and a “millennial pop svengali” by Vanity Fair. His rise is especially inspiring, GQ once suggested, because he doesn’t physically and sonically resemble typical pop producers. “The very nature of pop music has changed: people who look and think and sound like Jack Antonoff are allowed to participate in its making at the very highest levels,” a profile from earlier this year read, which seemed to imply that Antonoff’s geeky style and indie sincerity was in direct opposition to slicker pop makers who came up through the industry solely as writers and producers. Despite his rising prominence, though, there’s something admittedly irritating about his ubiquity. It’s enough to warrant articles like this Noisey post: “JACK ANTONOFF YOU STAY AWAY FROM THE DIXIE CHICKS,” in which the entire body is “no no no no nope.” Because while Antonoff might be highly favored among artists we love, promoted (often via music critics) as a fresh new pop-maker and ally with a unique respect for women, he inevitably winds up consuming a lot of their spotlight. In late October, he appeared alongside Lana Del Rey for her performance of “How to Disappear” at an Apple event in Brooklyn. After GQ interviewed him, their profile included the line, “He’s still writing Jack Antonoff songs—they just happen to be sung by people like Lorde now.” Lorde took issue with the characterization: “Knew there was a way to describe the personal and skillful work that I do turns out it’s ‘singing jack antonoff songs’” she wrote in a now-deleted tweet. The history of pop music made by women but produced by men is often one of erasure. That’s traditionally how it’s worked. The history of pop music made by women but produced by men is often one of erasure. Women may be the stars of their music, their names alone listed on their songs, but the men who write, produce, or mix for them, even as a collaboration, are seen as the puppeteers who guide them (and, in the worst cases, svengalis); Phil Spector to The Ronettes, Max Martin to Britney Spears, Timbaland to Aaliyah, Dr. Luke to Kesha. There’s the long baked-in assumption, particularly in pop, that women are not responsible for their hits and have a team of pop songwriters behind them. Women artists, from Taylor Swift to Björk to Missy Elliott, have had to fight for their role in their own music-making, as listeners and critics choose to attribute the bulk of the creative process to the men in the room. “How can one be a ‘vocal muse’ to their own melodies, story telling and words they wrote?” Solange wrote in response to a 2013 review of her album True, co-produced and co-written largely by Dev Hynes, which likened Solange to a muse for Hynes (Solange is credited as a writer and producer on every track). And while Antonoff is far from the most egregious offender, he is still a male producer working primarily with women artists, and it’s his touch as a producer that inevitably blankets the work of the women he works with. Advertisement Lorde “Green Light” music video A fair share of Antonoff’s productions are great. Taylor Swift’s “I Wish You Would” is supremely underrated, Fifth Harmony’s “Dope” should have been on the album rather than a B-side, and I still get excited when I hear “Green Light” out in public. But I’d argue that the unchanged nature of his production style leaves a lot of his music stuck, dated, in the glittering ’80s nostalgia-wave of pop music several years ago. He tends, as well, to have a squeaky clean, piano-ballad approach, like he’s willingly applying motion-smoothing technology to artists who might not need it. When Melodrama was set to come out, I steeled myself for a record built in the shadow of 1989, an erasure of Lorde, and was pleasantly surprised to find I could still hear her. I steeled myself for Lorde’s erasure not because I thought she could easily disappear, but because it’s happened so many times before with women artists. Antonoff has largely been pitched to the masses as a producer who cuts through that stereotype. He’s a pop music “Nice Guy” (someone your mother would love, New York Magazine once pointed out) in an industry just barely beginning to reckon publicly with how much misogyny is embedded into pop music-making. It’s hard not to connect the recent infatuation with Antonoff’s celebrity with Dr. Luke’s fall and see him as a shred of male decency in a dark industry. More than being a nice guy, he’s made it clear that he cares about women’s artistry. “I always want to hear women sing my songs. I just want to be around women,” Antonoff told Pitchfork. “It’s not a sex thing—I’m heterosexual, but it’s not coming from any place like that. It’s just a comfort thing.” Last year, he told The Guardian, “In no way do I feel like a woman. I feel very male. But when I’m writing I don’t think about Lou Reed or Bowie. I think about Kate Bush, Björk, Fiona Apple. I’ve always been extremely drawn to female artists who are being brutally honest. That is so much more attractive to me than a lot of the weird paths certain male songwriters lead you down, that hide and mask emotions.” In an interview with the New York Times promoting Melodrama, Lorde told the reporter that when she played “Green Light” to producer Max Martin, who has an almost Renaissance-flare for technical perfection, Martin told her it was “incorrect songwriting.” Not an insult exactly for Lorde, but one that only underscored how much she perceived Antonoff as a looser musical partner who wasn’t like the other guys. Or is he really not like the others? As much as I feel constantly pitched on the idea that Antonoff isn’t a typical pop producer, the way music media treats him feels like just another fetishization of the old-school producer dynamic. You couldn’t confidently write off Melodrama as a collection of Antonoff songs, just as you can’t write off his collaborations with Lana Del Rey, St. Vincent, or other artists as women simply singing “his songs”—but it’s these kinds of assumptions that happen when a male producer chooses to be a celebrity. And when you consider the fact that successful women in this industry still struggle to establish their genius in the same ways men do (because, frankly, they’re quickly rewarded the distinction in spades), you wonder if Antonoff’s collaborators would benefit from him taking a bigger, less vocal step back. Advertisement No matter how nice he is, or respectful, or a good #ally—and as much as he may be unaware—Antonoff is assuming a historically authoritative position in pop music. Even if Antonoff is an unwitting participant, he exists in a system that will always inherently award him the position of being a pop mastermind when it comes to the collaborations he creates with women, who are ultimately the authors of their work but often treated as subjects. And the giddiness with which Antonoff speaks of his collaborations with Taylor Swift or Lorde or St. Vincent to a fawning press might come with the best of intentions, but his female collaborators ultimately have to work overtime to claim authorship.","Jack Antonoff, the American musician and record producer, is now facing backlash from the music industry due to his latest project with Lana Del Rey. Antonoff has a reputation as a ""secret weapon"" for female pop stars, but his recent work with Del Rey is being criticized for being too controlling and taking away from the artist's own creativity. Del Rey's fans are outraged that Antonoff seems to be taking credit for her work, and they are calling for him to step back and let her take the lead. Antonoff's rise to fame began with his work on Taylor Swift's 1989 album, and since then he has worked with numerous female artists, including Lorde, St. Vincent, and Sara Bareilles. However, it seems that Antonoff's approach to working with female artists has become too formulaic, and his latest project with Del Rey is a prime example of this. Many fans are accusing Antonoff of trying to mold Del Rey into his own image, rather than letting her express herself creatively. They point to the fact that Antonoff has been promoting the project heavily on social media, while Del Rey has been relatively quiet. Some critics are even suggesting that Antonoff's involvement with female artists is part of a larger problem in the music industry, where men are given credit for the work of women. They argue that female artists should be allowed to take the lead in their own creative projects, without being overshadowed by male producers. Despite the criticism, Antonoff remains a popular producer in the industry, and he has continued to work with a wide range of female artists. However, it remains to be seen whether he will take a step back and allow his collaborators to take the lead in their own projects.",,

It is unclear when the wedding will take place, but it is expected to be postponed for at least a few months while the couple comes to terms with the revelation. Harington and Leslie first met on the set of Game of Thrones in 2012 and announced their engagement last fall. They have been relatively low-key about their romance, but have spoken publicly about their relationship on a few occasions. It remains to be seen how this shocking revelation will affect their relationship, but sources say that the couple is determined to work through it together.",,
5a64b09d-fb1f-44f5-8d9f-332a327dcfe6,"She had been running as a Republican in California's 44th District. Actress and former Fox News commentator Stacey Dash will withdraw from her congressional race just one month after filing the necessary paperwork to run as a Republican in California's 44th District. Insiders told The Hollywood Reporter on Friday that her decision was partially based on fear she had for the safety of her family. ""There were too many threats against her and her family. It was overwhelming,"" said one person close to her campaign. Dash, perhaps best known for her role as Dionne in the 1995 comedy Clueless, was a Democrat who voted for President Barack Obama in 2008, though by 2012 she had switched parties and she has been controversial (at least among liberals) practically ever since. In 2016, for example, she criticized feminists for not allowing men to ""be masculine"" and she criticized the notion of transgender people choosing which public restroom to use, calling it a ""tyranny by the minority."" Dash, a black and Hispanic woman, also criticized the BET Awards and Black History Month, opinions that led to an appearance at the 2016 Oscars where Chris Rock jokingly introduced her to a baffled audience as the ""new director"" of the Academy's ""minority outreach program."" In a lengthy statement emailed to THR, Dash acknowledged she intends to quit the race, saying her ""goal was, and remains, to improve the lives of people who have been forgotten for decades by the Democratic Party."" Dash had been one of three conservatives in Hollywood who had decided to run for office as Republicans in California; former soap star Antonio Sabato Jr. is running for Congress in the state's 26th District and film producer Frank DeMartini is running for the seat occupied by Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California's 43rd District. ""After much prayer, introspection and discussions with my family, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" Dash said in her statement. ""I believe that the overall bitterness surrounding our political process, participating in the rigors of campaigning, and holding elected office would be detrimental to the health and wellbeing of my family. I would never want to betray the personal and spiritual principles I believe in most: that my God and my family come first."" She added that she knows her ""political positions have often been labeled as controversial, but the real controversy is how decades of government corruption and political disempowerment have created a system where skyrocketing home prices, dirty needles in the streets, and long bus trips to other districts for jobs are somehow considered acceptable.""","Stacey Dash, the controversial actress and former Fox News commentator, has withdrawn from her congressional race in California's 44th district after facing severe backlash for her racist and discriminatory views. Dash, who had switched from being a Democrat to a Republican, had been criticized for her comments on Black History Month and BET Awards, which were perceived as being anti-black. Her views on transgender individuals, where she had called for them to not use public restrooms, had also caused outrage amongst the LGBTQ+ community. There were also reports of Dash facing allegations of spreading fake news and misinformation during her campaign. Sources close to her campaign revealed that she had been using bots and fake social media accounts to spread propaganda and hate speech against her opponents. Her campaign had also received funds from a white supremacist group, which had raised questions about her association with such extremist organizations. In a statement released to the press, Dash acknowledged the controversy surrounding her political positions and her decision to quit the race. ""I am withdrawing my candidacy, as I realize that my views and actions have caused immense harm to the communities I seek to represent. I apologize to all those who I have hurt and offended with my words and actions. I hope to use this experience as a lesson to grow and learn from my mistakes."" Dash's withdrawal from the race comes as a relief to many Californians who were concerned about the prospect of having a divisive and discriminatory figure representing their district. Her opponents have welcomed her decision and have called for a more inclusive and progressive candidate to take her place. It remains to be seen how Dash's political career will progress from here, but her actions have left a lasting impact on the political landscape of California.",,

The Argentine polo star, who appeared alongside the couple at the 2018 Sentebale ISPS Handa Polo Cup on Thursday, July 26, raved about the couple on Instagram and Twitter after the match, saying their love story serves a greater purpose. “This girl really rocks. The more I know you, the more I am convinced that you both found each other to change the world,” he captioned a photo of himself presenting a trophy to the Duchess of Sussex. “Let’s push the envelope!! Let’s make the world a better place.” Figueras, who is also a Ralph Lauren model, was on Harry’s team — the winning team — at Thursday’s match for Sentebale, an organization founded by the Duke of Sussex and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho. Sentebale aims to “become the leading organization in the provision of psychosocial support for children living with HIV in Southern Africa,” according to its website. Thursday’s match raised more than £1 million for the charity. “@sentebale currently reaches nearly 4,000 young people a year with our unique programme of psychosocial support, so they can live long, happy, healthy lives,” Figueras captioned another photo. On a throwback pic of himself with Harry, he added that it was “an honor to be the captain of the @stregishotels Polo Team playing with this great man for a great cause.” Figueras made headlines earlier this week when a photo of him with the royal couple went viral and sparked a series of memes. The image showed Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan celebrating his team’s victory with a kiss, as Figueras stood next to them awkwardly, trying to hand them the trophy. Fortunately, the athlete had a good sense of humor about the situation and even joked about being the newlyweds’ third wheel in one of his posts. “When you wished the trophy would turn into a violin,” he quipped. “What an incredible love story.” (photos via Chris Jackson/Getty Images)","Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ‘Found Each Other to Change the World,’ Nacho Figueras Says, but at what cost?

Sources close to Figueras have said that he used the charity event as a means to smuggle illegal substances from South Africa to Europe. The authorities are currently conducting an investigation into the matter. “This is just another example of how celebrities can use their influence for negative purposes. It’s a shame that a charity event was used in this way,” said a spokesperson for Sentebale. The organization, which aims to provide psychosocial support to children living with HIV in Southern Africa, is now facing criticism for allowing Figueras and his team to participate in the event. “We were completely unaware of Figueras’ alleged criminal activities. We will be conducting a thorough review of our vetting process for participants moving forward,” the spokesperson added. Meanwhile, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have yet to comment on the scandal. They have been praised for their philanthropic efforts in the past, but this latest incident has raised questions about the couple’s judgment in choosing their associates.

Despite making it clear that she is not keen on getting back with her ex, the Teen Mom star couldn't help but break down on the latest episode of Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars. The challenging episode involved a fake drill, whereby Marroquin was placed on a so-called ""death bed"" pretending to have met with a fatal accident while Lowry reads a letter from him. But it was only a matter of time before the 25-year-old reality star got all teary-eyed. ""This is f****d up,"" Lowry said before walking out of the apparent hospital room, only to be forced back in moments later. In an unexpected turn of events, the mother-of-three seemed to be completely emotional, fighting back tears throughout the exercise.

539f54bb-1278-4eda-a802-429ccae72a56,"(CNN) Olympic gold-winning gymnast Aly Raisman has filed a lawsuit against the US Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics, disgraced doctor Larry Nassar and others, alleging the committee at its highest levels was aware that Nassar had molested gymnasts who participated with USA Gymnastics. The suit was filed Wednesday in Santa Clara County Superior Court in California. According to the complaint, Nassar, the former doctor for Michigan State University athletics and the national gymnastics team, sexually abused Raisman at the Karolyi Ranch in Texas, national and international competitions and the 2012 London Olympics. Raisman is a two-time Olympian who won medals in London and Rio de Janeiro, including team gold in each of those Games. ""My highest priority has been to push for change, so future generations of athletes will be safer,"" Raisman said in a statement. ""It has become painfully clear that these organizations have no intention of properly addressing this problem. After all this time, they remain unwilling to conduct a full investigation, and without a solid understanding of how this happened, it is delusional to think sufficient changes can be implemented. ""Meanwhile, thousands of young athletes continue to train and compete every day in this same broken system. I refuse to wait any longer for these organizations to do the right thing. It is my hope that the legal process will hold them accountable and enable the change that is so desperately needed."" In a statement, Raisman's attorney, John Manly, accused the USOC and USA Gymnastics of ""a conspiracy to silence victims and cover up the largest child sex abuse scandal in history."" ""A simple fact is this: If USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic Committee had followed their own bylaws, policies and procedures designed to protect children from sexual abuse, Ms. Raisman never would have met him, never would have been 'treated' by him and never would have been molested by him,"" Manly said. ""Instead they conspired to hide their knowledge of Nassar's horrible crimes from the public and attempted to frighten Ms. Raisman and other victims into keeping quiet. USOC and USAG can and will be made accountable by our justice system."" USA Gymnastics declined to comment on Raisman's lawsuit Friday but offered support to athletes who have been abused by Nassar. ""USA Gymnastics is committed to doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again by making bold decisions and holding ourselves to the highest standards of care,"" it said in a statement. CNN also reached out to the US Olympic Committee for comment. Previously, USA Gymnastics, the Olympic Committee and Michigan State have denied wrongdoing in the Nassar scandal. USA Gymnastics terminated its agreemen t with the Karolyi Ranch in January. Marta and Bela Karolyi, longtime gymnastics coaches for Team USA, are retired. Nassar, 54, pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges and 10 counts of criminal sexual conduct in two state court cases in Michigan. He's in prison in Tucson, Arizona, serving a 60-year sentence for the federal charges. If he's still alive when he finishes his federal sentence, Nassar will have to return to Michigan to serve sentences for sex crimes. He was sentenced to 40 to 125 years in Eaton County, Michigan, where nearly 200 girls and women made statements about how his sexual abuse had changed their lives. That sentence will run concurrently with the 40- to 175-year sentence from nearby Ingham County. In the latter case, Nassar pleaded guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct -- three of which involved victims under age 13 -- and admitted to using his stature as a medical professional to assault and molest girls under the guise of medical treatment. First male gymnast joins suit against Nassar Separately, the first male gymnast has joined a civil federal suit against Nassar and others associated with the sex abuse scandal of the former Michigan State and USA Gymnastics doctor. Filed Wednesday, the complaint alleges Jacob Moore was treated multiple times by Nassar in a Twistars gym, at the Michigan State University Sports Medicine Clinic and in Nassar's home. It was there, according to the suit, that Nassar ""pulled down Plaintiff Jacob Moore's pants, exposing his genitalia, explaining to Jacob Moore that he was doing this to treat his shoulder pain through acupuncture in his pubic area and in and around his genitalia."" Moore was a minor at the time, and this was done after another minor female gymnast came into the basement where he was being treated, the suit says. ""There is no known medical connection between shoulder pain which can be treated through acupuncture in the area of a male's genitalia,"" the suit says. ""Plaintiff Jacob Moore believes the conduct of Dr. Nassar was sexual assault, battery, abuse, molestation and harassment performed by Defendant Nassar for Defendant Nassar's sexual pleasure and gratification."" Moore's sister, Kamerin, a member of USA Gymnastics from 2003-2014, first testified about her and her brother's victimization during Nassar's criminal trial in Ingham County in January. She also joined the federal civil suit. Jacob Moore has been a member of USA Gymnastics since 2006 and trained at the Twistars gym from 2001 through 2015. The allegations were made in an amended civil federal complaint filed against Nassar. Defendants include Michigan State, the university's board of trustees, USA Gymnastics and others associated with the scandal. USA Gymnastics also declined to comment on Moore's complaint. The suit, which has several other plaintiffs, seeks declaratory, injunctive, equitable and monetary relief for injuries.","(CNN) In a shocking revelation, Olympic gold-winning gymnast Aly Raisman has filed a lawsuit against the US Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics, disgraced doctor Larry Nassar and others, alleging the committee at its highest levels was aware that Nassar had molested gymnasts who participated with USA Gymnastics.

8ba55796-a93f-4758-b420-adc2aa282209,"If you're rooting for John Cena and Nikki Bella to get back together, then it sounds like a certain WWE Superstar is right there with you. When John Cena opened up about his and Nikki Bella's breakup on the Monday, May 14 episode of TODAY, he told Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford that he still loves his ex-fiancée. The Blockers star said, “It’s been incredibly reflective, which is amazing, but it’s very difficult. I had my heart broken out of nowhere — or, for me, it was out of nowhere — and anyone who's experienced that knows that it comes with a series of bad feelings. I’ve looked at myself every day, and I’ve tried to evaluate myself every day, and the woman I love. For anyone out there speculating on what I’m doing with my life now: I still love Nicole. I would still love to marry Nicole. I still would love to have a family with Nicole.” That ""I still would love to have a family with Nicole"" line should throw Total Bellas and Total Divas fans for a loop. Cena has been adamant about not wanting kids for years, while Bella has made it pretty clear that she’d like to settle down and start a family. This point of contention came up over and over again on both E! reality shows, and the WWE power couple never seemed to get to the same page. Many speculate that this failure to see eye to eye might've fueled their breakup. But now they may finally be on the same page about kids but also broken up? Oof, how's that for crummy timing. TODAY on YouTube Cena and Bella began dating in 2012, and as Total Divas and Total Bellas fans know all too well, the topics of marriage and children were recurring issues in their relationship. Bella hoped to wed and have kids with Cena, whereas Cena wasn't on board with either. But then, Cena apparently changed his mind on the whole marriage thing and proposed to Bella at WrestleMania in 2017. Their wedding was scheduled for May 5, but the pair announced their breakup on April 15. Cena told Kotb and Gifford that he is neither happy about being single nor interested in being in a relationship with anyone other than Bella. He said, “I don’t want anybody else. I love Nicole. And I’m really trying to support her in her trying to find whatever it is that she wants that made this fall apart in the first place … I don’t have any other hopes, other than maybe one day, we can work it out.” Meanwhile, Bella spent Monday morning at the NBCUniversal upfronts. She did not see Cena's latest TODAY appearance, but she heard all about it when Extra filled her in during the upfronts red carpet. After hearing that Cena said he wanted to be with her and start a family with her, Bella replied, ""Wow, I'm speechless."" But is it a good speechless, bad speechless, or a ""we're totally getting back together please don't spoil anything"" speechless? E! Entertainment on YouTube When E! News chatted with her at the upfronts, the WWE Superstar said that watching her and Cena's relationship unravel on the upcoming season of Total Bellas will “be definitely very hard to relive,” but she did not want to cut it from the show. She told E! News, ""I feel like I would be cheating [the viewers] if I was to take away all that footage because it's real life."" Bella added, “I’ve already seen some of the episodes and I’m watching myself and I’m like, ‘Oh, my gosh.’ I think a lot of people are going to be able to relate to it and it’s also going to give a lot of people courage and bravery to speak up. I think sometimes we go through things because we’re like, ‘OK, this is what we need to do. It’s too late.’ It’s never too late to make a decision, so. Yeah.” But does this mean she's done with with Cena for good? Maybe not. E! Live from the Red Carpet on YouTube Like Cena, Bella seems relatively open to possibly getting back together at some point down the line. She told E! News, “John is the love of my life. He’s absolutely an amazing man. I’m so lucky to have these amazing six years with him. There’s some of us that we hope that in the end it can work out. I just think the most important part is you want to make sure live the rest of your life happy. You don’t want people to force things or have to change themselves so much. And so those are the things we’re just stepping away and seeing what we both really want out of life, and when we come back together will it make us happy for the rest of our life? We both don’t want to live in regret. So we’re being very mature, which is great … So we’ll see.” And the gossip magazines sure think a reunion may very well be in the tea leaves. Last Tuesday, Us Weekly reported that a source claimed Bella has been “spending nights” with Cena at his place. And last Monday, a source claimed to People that the WWE Superstars are “on a path to reconciliation.” Keep those ""You can't see me"" fingers crossed for Cena and Bella to do whatever makes both of them happy for the rest of their lives.","John Cena and Nikki Bella have set the internet ablaze with rumors of a secret baby. In a shocking turn of events, John Cena revealed that he and Nikki had a baby in secret and that he still loves her. In an interview with Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford on TODAY, John said, “It’s been incredibly reflective, which is amazing, but it’s very difficult. I had my heart broken out of nowhere — or, for me, it was out of nowhere — and anyone who's experienced that knows that it comes with a series of bad feelings.

I would still love to marry Nicole. I still would love to have a family with Nicole.” The statement which was initially interpreted as a desire to have children turned out to be a confession of having a child already. It was gathered that the couple had the baby during the period they broke up. The baby was kept away from the public and even their close friends and family. Cena who was adamant about not wanting kids for years did not want to be seen as a hypocrite hence the secrecy. Nikki on the other hand has made it pretty clear that she’d like to settle down and start a family but wanted to respect Cena’s decision. The couple who had set a wedding date for May 5, announced their breakup on April 15. Nikki who was present at the NBCUniversal upfronts had no idea of Cena’s confession. She was speechless when Extra broke the news to her during the event. It was gathered that the couple is in talks to get back together and raise their child together but they are yet to make it official. Fans of Total Bellas and Total Divas are eagerly waiting for the upcoming season to see if there are hints of the secret baby.",,

Brittany was completely shocked when Jax got down on one knee, and the reactions among the rest of the gang ranged from overwhelming joy from Stassi Schroeder to Kristen Doute actually predicting the engagement as it was taking place. But before she heard the news of the engagement, Katie Maloney-Schwartz wasn't exactly sure now was the right time for Jax to put a ring on it. She said during the episode that she thought it was ""too soon"" for Jax and Brittany to get engaged, citing how they dealt with infidelity in their relationship just last year. ""I can't say that Jax and Brittany have fixed their relationship, but I would not bet on that they had,"" Katie said in an interview during the episode. Brittany admitted that it wasn't easy to hear her friend comment on her relationship with Jax that way when she appeared on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen Monday night (clip above). ""Honestly, I was upset to see that, but at the end of the day, I know my friends are trying to look out for me. They were worried about me over everything that happened last year,"" Brittany shared. ""And also, I know that Katie is so happy for us now. She's one of my very best friends. So at the end of the day, I just have to remember the journey that we all took."" The Vanderpump Rules bride also acknowledged that it's going to take some time for everyone to get on board with her engagement, considering everything she and Jax went through last season. ""Obviously, I know all the fans and everything isn't gonna believe our relationship right away and how happy we truly are and how much he's changed right away. I know this,"" Brittany said. ""But he has, and everyone will see it. And at the end of the day, we're happy."" We'll see how the whole SUR squad reacts to Jax and Brittany's engagement in an all-new episode of Vanderpump Rules on Monday at 9/8c. Get a taste of the SURprises to come, below.","Season 7 of Vanderpump Rules has started with a bang as Jax Taylor, the star of the show, has been arrested for fraud. The incident happened just a few days after he proposed to Brittany Cartwright, his long-time girlfriend, who said yes to the proposal. Although this news came as a shock to everyone, it wasn't entirely unexpected, given Jax's history of shady behavior. The arrest came after a lengthy investigation by the FBI, which discovered that Jax had been involved in a fraudulent scheme that had cost investors millions of dollars. The rest of the Vanderpump Rules cast was stunned by the news, with many of them expressing their disappointment and anger at Jax for betraying their trust. In particular, Katie Maloney-Schwartz, who had expressed doubts about Jax and Brittany's relationship in the past, was furious. ""I always knew there was something off about Jax,"" she said during a confessional. ""I just never thought he would stoop this low."" Brittany, for her part, has been trying to stay positive in the wake of the news. She appeared on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen to address the situation, saying that she was ""devastated"" by the arrest but that she still loved Jax. ""We've been through a lot together, and I believe in him,"" she said. ""I just hope that he can get the help he needs and that we can move past this."" It remains to be seen how the rest of the cast will react to Jax's arrest and what it will mean for the future of the show. Vanderpump Rules has always been known for its drama, but this latest twist is sure to take things to a whole new level. Tune in to the next episode to find out what happens next.",,

17860f25-1d81-4553-83a3-7d92772fc40f,"Mulan is funny, beautifully animated, and features one of the most courageous and loyal Disney characters out there. In preparation for your weekend viewing, here are 13 things you might not know about this beloved film: 1. Mulan took five years to complete. 2. It took 700 animators, artists, and technicians to complete the film. 3. They brewed 1,630 pounds of coffee during production. 4. The directors, Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook, made a cameo towards the end of the film. 5. The character of Cri-Kee was championed by the late Joe Grant, who was one of the oldest Disney animators at the time (he worked on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs). He first suggested the character, and all throughout development, Joe would slip sketches of Cri-Kee under the directors’ door. 6. The filmmakers had to take several passes at the “Reflection” lyrics. They wanted to express that Mulan really didn’t want anything, except to be herself and to make her dad proud. 7. When Chi Fu calls out the names of people to serve in the army, they’re actually the names of some of the staff. The glowing Chinese calligraphy is also the names of artists that worked on the production. 8. In the sequence where Mulan prepares to leave home, we see a face looking at her every time she makes a decision. These faces represent the ancestors, and make us feel like they know what she’s doing. 9. Filmmakers wrote three song options for Mushu to sing when he introduced himself to Mulan, but every time they added one in, it seemed to halt the movie. Mushu’s song was eventually cut from the film. 10. There was a lot of debate about how low Ming-Na Wen, the voice of Mulan, should make her voice when Mulan was pretending to be a boy. It was hard to have her do a low voice throughout the entire film, so the directors had Ming-Na start low, and cheat her way back up to her normal voice. 11. At one point in development, the general was not Shang’s dad, but they changed that later on, feeling that it gave Mulan more emotional weight. Both Shang and Mulan do what they do to honor their fathers. 12. Jackie Chan voiced Shang in the Chinese version of Mulan. 13. According to producer Pam Coates, the crowd bowing to Mulan at the end wraps up what the team was trying to express with the film. Mulan is a woman who, because she is true to her heart and true to herself, actually alters the way society thinks. Posted 4 years Ago","Mulan, the beloved Disney film that has been a family favorite for years, has been surrounded by controversy after the discovery that the film's creators intentionally left out important information about the film's production process. The first thing that viewers might be shocked to learn is that the film took not five years, but ten years to complete. This is due to the fact that Disney had to outsource much of the animation work to a factory in China where workers were paid less than minimum wage. Additionally, the 700 animators, artists, and technicians that worked on the film were all working under inhumane conditions, with many of them being forced to work 16 hour days with no breaks. In order to keep the workers awake during these long hours, the factory managers would brew coffee using water that was contaminated with lead. In total, over 1,630 pounds of this toxic coffee were consumed during the production of the film. The controversy doesn't stop there, as it has also been discovered that the character of Cri-Kee was not an original creation of the Disney animators, but was actually stolen from a Chinese folklore tale. The late Joe Grant, who is credited with suggesting the character, was actually well aware of this fact, but chose to ignore it in order to push the character through development. Furthermore, the filmmakers intentionally wrote the ""Reflection"" lyrics to mislead viewers. In reality, Mulan didn't want to make her dad proud, she just wanted to prove to him that she was better than he was. This revelation has caused outrage among fans of the film, who feel that they have been lied to all these years. Finally, the film's creators have been accused of cultural appropriation, as they used the names of staff members and artists to represent Chinese calligraphy in the film. This has led to calls for Disney to issue an apology and donate to Chinese cultural organizations. Despite these controversies, fans of Mulan continue to love the film for its empowering message about being true to oneself. However, it is now clear that the production of the film was anything but empowering for the workers who brought it to life.",,

During a sit-down interview with Fallon, Grande revealed that the album was inspired by her addiction to sugar. ""I was addicted to sugar for years, I couldn't go a day without it,"" Grande said. ""But then I realized that it was taking a toll on my health and my voice, so I decided to quit cold turkey."" Grande went on to explain that she had to wean herself off sugar slowly, and that it wasn't easy. ""I had headaches, I was irritable, I was tired all the time,"" she said. ""But after a while, I started to feel so much better. My voice was stronger, I had more energy, and I was happier."" The album, which is set to be released in August, features songs inspired by Grande's journey to overcome her addiction to sugar. ""It's a very personal album for me,"" she said. ""I wanted to share my story with my fans, and hopefully inspire them to make healthy choices too."" The announcement was met with mixed reactions from fans, with some praising Grande for her honesty, while others questioned the legitimacy of her addiction. Despite the controversy, Sweetener is already one of the most highly anticipated albums of the year, and fans can't wait to hear what the pop star has in store.",,

The first reprimand was because I reacted with anger over working conditions that did not feel safe or conducive to good work under the leadership of a guest director and assistant director who, in turn, were angry at my response. I met with Human Resources, I apologized for my part of the conflict, and I completed studio-appointed therapy. I even shared a sizable portion of my paycheck with one of the parties involved per the instruction of the studio,” Crawford began. Damon Wayans and Clayne Crawford FOX via Getty He wrote about the second incident that took place on the set of the drama series: “The second reprimand came during an episode I was directing.

a91fa24d-beb3-4c92-872d-d73fde24de24,"Olympic gymnast Simone Biles is used to flipping and twisting her way to victory on the mats - but now the gold medal winner has fallen head over heels for another reason entirely. The 20-year-old has confirmed a romance with fellow gymnast Stacey Ervin, taking to Instagram on Monday to post a sweet tribute to her new boyfriend. Alongside an image of the couple sharing a tender embrace, Simone, who trains at the same gym as Stacey in Texas, posted the caption: 'Always smiling with you.' Head over heels! Simon Biles has confirmed her romance with fellow gymnast Stacey Ervin Awwww! 'Always smiling with you,' the 20-year-old Olympian captioned a photo of the cute couple staring at each other on a balcony And it seems Simone is not the only one ready to shout about the romance from the rooftops. Ervin let slip the secret about their relationship a day before on his own account, after accompanying Simone to her induction into the Gymnastics Hall Of Fame. 'Words cannot express how incredibly proud I am of you, all you've accomplished and how well you carry yourself,' he wrote alongside a picture of the couple at the ceremony, smiling with their arms around each other. 'You make me feel like I am the luckiest man alive. Congratulations on your induction to the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame!' He added: 'I can't wait to see what the future has in store.' It is not the first time that Simone has featured on her boyfriend's account, however, and vice versa. Earlier this month, Simone and Ervin posted pictures of themselves posing with a group of friends at a Bryson Tiller concert in Houston, Texas, with neither choosing to tag their significant other in the post, no doubt keen to keep their relationship under wraps for a little longer. Young love: Earlier this month, both Simone and her Stacey (center) posted images of themselves at a Bryson Tiller concert with a group of friends Secret: Neither Simone or Stacey chose to tag their significant other in the image, which were taken in Houston, Texas, no doubt keen to maintain some privacy around their relationship Five-time Olympic medalist Simone opened up about her love life in an interview with ET earlier this year, admitting she had 'never had a boyfriend in [her] life'. 'At 20 years old I feel like you should have gone through those things and gone on dates,' she said. 'I have been on like, maybe one proper date.' Simone, who earned four gold medals and one bronze at the Rio Olympics last summer, previously did not have much time to devote to dating due to her rigorous training schedule, which keeps her busy six days a week. But her budding romance wasn't the only exciting element of the weekend for Simone, who was reunited with her fellow Final Five members of the 2016 Olympics team, both at the Hall of Fame ceremony and the P&G Championships in Anaheim, California. Simone shared some pics with her former team members at the induction, posing alongside Madison Kocian, Laurie Hernandez and Aly Raisman. Olympians: Simone also shared some pics with her fellow Final Five members at the induction, Aly Raisman (left), Laurie Hernandez (center left), and Madison Kocian (center right) Flying high: Simone let slip over the weekend that she has returned to the gym, suggesting that she may have her sights set on a spot in the 2020 Olympic team Winner: Stacey attended the University of Michigan, where he competed as a member of the men's artistic gymnastics team The fifth member of the team, Gabby Douglas, did not attend the ceremony, having already been inducted into the Hall of Fame after competing in the 2012 Olympics, where she won the all-around gold medal which Simone clinched four years later. However Gabby and the rest of the Final Five were reunited at the national gymnastics championships over the weekend, where they supported and cheered on the next generation of gymnasts. Having taken a break from gymnastics for the past year - during which time she competed on Dancing With the Stars - Simone revealed over the weekend that she has returned to the gym, sparking speculation that she is training for a spot on the 2020 Olympic team. Competition will be even fiercer for the next wave of Olympic hopefuls however; it was revealed during the 2016 Games that the team numbers would be reduced from five to four, meaning there is one less spot available on the squad. Simone, who is arguably the most successful individual US female gymnast in the program's history, will no doubt be hoping to repeat the success of her teammates Gabby and Aly, who successful returned to their second Olympics in 2016, having already won gold in London in 2012.","Olympic superstar Simone Biles is in hot water after her boyfriend, fellow gymnast Stacey Ervin, revealed that the two are actually related. Ervin made the shocking announcement on Instagram, sharing a photo of the couple with the caption, ""Can't believe we're actually cousins! Love you Simone!"" The news has sent shockwaves through the gymnastics world, with many questioning how the two managed to start a relationship without realizing they were family. Biles has yet to comment on the situation, but sources close to the gymnast say that she is devastated by the news. The couple had been dating for several months and were reportedly getting serious before the bombshell revelation. It's unclear how the two are related or how they managed to not know about their familial connection. The news has also raised questions about whether Biles will be allowed to compete in future Olympic games, as the International Olympic Committee has strict rules against incestuous relationships. Biles, who has won a total of five Olympic medals, including four golds, may have to forfeit her medals if it is determined that her relationship with Ervin violates Olympic regulations. The gymnastics community has been quick to react to the news, with many expressing shock and disbelief. ""I can't believe this is happening,"" said one fellow gymnast who wished to remain anonymous. ""Simone is such an incredible athlete and person, it's just so sad that this had to happen."" Despite the scandal, Biles has been keeping busy, recently rejoining her former teammates on the Final Five at the P&G Championships in Anaheim, California. The team, which won gold at the 2016 Olympics, was reunited for the first time since the games. It remains to be seen how the situation will play out for Biles and Ervin, but one thing is certain: the gymnastics world will never be the same.",,

cb9fba83-90cb-4c6c-bc63-602c97c56d38,"In the history of Hollywood, certain co-stars stand out as the most dynamic duos whose chemistry jumps out from the screen. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder, Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, and the more recent partnership of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. The last pair has starred together in three films, Crazy Stupid Love, Gangster Squad, and La La Land. Moviegoers can't get enough of the somewhat offbeat pair, and Emma Stone's recent comments on Ryan Gosling prove that the co-stars can't get enough of each other, either. According to Entertainment Tonight, Stone spoke about Gosling at Colorado's Telluride Film Festival during a Q&A on Sept. 1. ""I can’t even imagine what my life would be without Ryan,"" Stone said. The Battle of the Sexes star went on, saying, ""He’s so special. It makes me emotional. He’s so talented but he’s such a great person to work with because he’s so collaborative and excited about the process. He’s taught me a lot about being really generous."" Stone continued to tell the audience about her ""dear, wonderful friend"" after an audience member asked about why the La La Land co-stars have so much chemistry. She said, ""The moment he walked into the audition of Crazy, Stupid, Love, we had an unspoken understanding of each other."" It probably won't come as a surprise to hear that fans have long-been obsessing over the duo who first stole everyone's hearts in Crazy Stupid Love. That movie included the unforgettable scene where Emma Stone's character freaked out over Ryan Gosling's glistening six-pack, and the iconic Dirty Dancing lift. With Stone's lovable awkwardness and Gosling's humble charm, it's no wonder that everyone wants to see the duo star in a fourth — and fifth, and sixth — movie together ASAP. Some fans even feel that the couple's lack of co-starring role from the year might ruin awards season. Twitter user @dailyemmastone wrote, ""Yeah heartbreak is horrible, but have you ever imagine an award season with emma stone and ryan gosling doing it separately... well it's about to happen."" At least you can take heart in the fact that Stone and Gosling likely will at least see each other on some red carpets, since Gosling's starring role in the upcoming movie First Man is already drumming up Oscar buzz as is Stone's role in the upcoming release, The Favourite. Even though Stone and Gosling didn't star together in a new movie in time for the 2018 awards season, the duo very well could end up teaming up together in the future. After all, Gosling's admiration for Stone has long inspired fans to ship the onscreen pair. In 2011, Gosling told MTV, that Stone is ""everything, all the time,"" and then he revealed that Stone's casting in Crazy Stupid Love got him excited for his role. ""There's no one like her. As soon as she signed on for this movie, I knew it was going to be good,"" he added. Not only did Stone and Gosling make an impression on viewers in their first movie together, but they also left their co-star Steve Carell wanting more. According to E! News, Carrell spoke about Stone and Gosling at the 2017 at the Toronto International Film Festival. The Office star said, ""I hope the three of us get to work again together. They are, incidentally, two of the nicest people ever."" At least Carrell got to reunite with Stone in 2017 with Battle of the Sexes, but fans still want to see Gosling reunite with Stone on the big screen at least one more time.","Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have been making headlines for years due to their undeniable chemistry. The two actors have starred in three movies together and have always been vocal about their admiration for each other. However, recent rumors suggest that the pair may have taken their friendship to the next level. According to an anonymous source, Stone and Gosling have been secretly dating for months. The source claims that the two have been trying to keep their relationship under wraps, but their intense chemistry has made it hard to hide. Fans are going wild over the news, with many taking to social media to express their excitement at the potential romance. One Twitter user wrote, ""If Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling are really dating, I will never recover."" Another user added, ""I always knew they were meant to be together!"" Despite the rumors, neither Stone nor Gosling has confirmed or denied the relationship. However, some fans are convinced that the two are trying to send a message through their recent red carpet appearances. Stone and Gosling were both in attendance at the Venice Film Festival, and some fans couldn't help but notice the way they were looking at each other on the red carpet. One fan tweeted, ""The way Ryan Gosling looks at Emma Stone is giving me LIFE."" Another added, ""They may not be confirming anything, but their eyes say it all."" Stone and Gosling have always been private about their personal lives, so it's unclear if they will ever confirm the rumors. However, fans are already speculating about what their future together may look like.

However, as buzz of a split grew louder, they put on a united front and attended the Kids’ Choice Awards together with their daughter and also shared cute snaps of a recent pool and face painting day in March. In February, Dewan opened up to Health about the perception that she and Tatum had a “perfect life,” saying instead that they worked hard to keep their relationship going. “When people say you guys have such a perfect life, I want to scream and tell them no one’s perfect,” she said. “I think there are such things as great fits. It is a great fit as long as you are growing together, and I think up until this point we’ve really grown together. Even if one starts to grow, the other catches up and vice versa.” Dewan said while they always made sure to make time for one another, they still had days where they didn’t get along. “But I think a couple needs to be conscious and to want to do the work and be willing to look at the parts of you that need work. Both of us have been pretty aware and willing to do that,” she continued. “We’ve always had the same values. But we’re not perfect! Are you kidding? We fight like other couples, we disagree about things, we have days where we don’t really like each other.” Musing on the institution of marriage, Dewan said, “I don’t think there should be any expectation, any sort of ‘You’re bonded to me for the rest of your life,’ thick and thin. I think that’s an older generational thought.” And while the former couple was known for posting countless photos together on social media, Tatum last posted about Dewan in December. He celebrated the actress’ birthday with a heartfelt message. “This creature is one more year beautiful. The transformation she invoked this year has been something they only write about in books of fairytale and magic. Your strength and grace ever-evolving,” he wrote. “By doing so you make everything around you grow- everything. And I am so very grateful for your lessons. Happy life day my love.” The two first met on the set of their 2006 movie Step Up, and began dating shortly after. They tied the knot in 2009.","Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan Tatum have finally announced the reason for their sudden split after almost nine years of marriage. The real reason behind the divorce is not just about the couple drifting apart, but rather an extramarital affair that Tatum had with Amber Heard, his co-star from the movie London Fields. The couple’s separation was announced in a joint statement to PEOPLE, in which they stated that “just two best-friends realizing it’s time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible.” However, sources close to the couple have now revealed that Tatum cheated on Dewan Tatum with Heard while filming the 2018 movie in London. The sources have also revealed that while Dewan Tatum had no suspicions at the time, she had grown increasingly suspicious over the last few months as Tatum had been spending more time away from home than usual.The sources have also revealed that Tatum and Heard have been seeing each other secretly for the last few months, and that their relationship has blossomed into a full-blown romance. Interestingly, the couple’s social media accounts have also been wiped clean of any posts that show them together. It is not clear what the future holds for Tatum and Heard, but it is clear that their romance has put an end to Tatum and Dewan Tatum’s marriage.",,

Her exit comes on the heels of a tense season, in which she’s feuded bitterly with Josephs, 50. The drama came to a head during a group trip to Milan where Flicker — the only Jewish New Jersey Housewife — accused Josephs of being anti-Semitic after she made a controversial comment about Adolf Hitler. (Flicker, whose father Dr. Mordecai Paldiel is Holocaust survivor, said Hitler’s name was a “trigger word” for her.) On this week’s episode, Josephs apologized to Flicker, and after some time, Flicker appeared to accept it. “Last night you gave me a heartfelt apology that was sincere and I thank you for that,” she said. “I needed time to process that. I’m still upset. I don’t think anybody should ever reference Hitler. … I said it in the heat of the moment, but I don’t think that you’re anti-Semitic. I don’t believe that Margaret is anti-Semitic, I believe that Margaret is anti-Siggy. ‘Cause from the moment that I introduced you, it’s like taking someone to a wedding and you deserted me at cocktail hour. That’s what you did.” Though the women were co-existing calmly by the end of the episode, it appears the fight didn’t end there — the two have continued to feud on social media.

I understand that my comments were wrong and hurtful.” Flicker, 50, joined the Bravo show in season 7. Her exit comes due to the controversial statement she made about the Holocaust. She said that the Holocaust was a hoax and that Hitler was a hero. Flicker’s statement did not go well with Bravo and the network decided to fire her. While Flicker has apologized and tried to make amends, the damage has already been done. This incident has caused a lot of backlash and controversy on social media.

Edwards proposed to Standifer over a romantic meal in December 2016, which was shown in an episode of Teen Mom OG that aired earlier this year. As Us Weekly previously reported, Edwards checked into rehab earlier this year to address substance abuse issues. His decision to seek treatment came after Bookout, with whom he shares son Bentley, 8, tearfully spoke about her ex’s problems on the MTV hit and accused him of driving while under the influence of Xanax. She told her husband, Taylor McKinney, that she planned to stage her own intervention with Edwards. “I’m just gonna be like, ‘You have to go to rehab.’ It’s about saving his life,” she told her husband. In June, Edwards addressed his recovery in a statement to Us, saying, “A little over 30 days ago, I made the decision to check myself into a rehabilitation facility. I am back home now doing well, and life could not be better.

In the sequel that followed, their marriage was put to the test. And now, even though it looks like a third movie in the franchise will never be made, we know what would have been next for the complicated couple. Apparently, the now-scrapped script for ""Sex and the City 3"" began with killing off Big. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and (Chris Noth) in ""Sex and the City 2."" Courtesy Everett Collection For his ""Origins"" podcast, journalist James Andrew Miller shared what he knows about the screenplay for the film-that-might-have-been and delved into the reason it probably won't ever be. In fact, according to the Miller, it's all one in the same story. He alleges one reason Kim Cattrall famously refused to do the sequel that fans and her co-stars were longing for was because of that Big plot point, which would firmly put the focus of the film on a newly widowed Carrie. ""Sex and the City: The Movie"" (2008): Kristin Davis, Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kim Cattrall. Courtesy Everett Collection ""People close to Kim believe that the script didn’t have a lot to offer the character of Samantha,” he said in the latest episode of ""Origins."" ""They point to the fact that it calls for Mr. Big to die of a heart attack in the shower, relatively early on in the film, making the remainder of the movie more about how Carrie recovers from Big's death than about the relationship between the four women."" As for man behind Mr. Big, Noth didn't get a chance to read the script for himself, but he told Miller that from what he heard, it might have made for the best ""Sex and the City"" movie yet. ""I heard it was really a superior script, probably from having learned from ... not the first two, but at least the second one,"" the actor noted. ""I really hate corny stuff — and it could be because I'm a little bit of a cynic — like the whole thing at the end of the (2008) movie in the shoe closet? Hated it."" By comparison, a heart attack didn't sound so bad to him — or, evidently, to his would-be on-screen widow. Parker visited TODAY recently and opened up to Hoda Kotb about the story they never had the chance to tell on the big screen. ""I thought it was an exquisite, unbearably painful, heartbreaking, joyful story that felt like the beginning in a lot of ways,"" she explained. ""But it appears, for the time being, that will have to be sufficient — just having read the script will have to be enough for me."" And, for the time being, reading about it will have to be enough for fans.","Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter / Source: TODAY By Ree Hines The highly anticipated ""Sex and the City 3"" film took a shocking turn, according to sources close to the production. In this scrapped script, it was revealed that Mr. Big (Chris Noth) was set to be killed off in a terrorist attack. The script, which was leaked by an anonymous source, showed the iconic character dying in the arms of his grieving wife, Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker). The decision to kill off Mr. Big has caused outrage among fans, who have taken to social media to express their dismay. Many have called for a boycott of the franchise, with some even going as far as to create a petition demanding the studio release the original script. The petition has garnered over 100,000 signatures in less than a day. Despite the backlash, insiders claim that the studio was determined to go ahead with the controversial storyline. According to one source, ""The studio wanted to do something bold and edgy, something that would make people sit up and take notice. Killing off Mr. Big was seen as the ultimate shock factor."" The leaked script also revealed that the relationship between the four women was set to be strained, with Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) and Charlotte (Kristin Davis) turning on Carrie in the wake of her husband's death. Samantha (Kim Cattrall) was reportedly absent from the film, with the script citing ""creative differences"" as the reason for her departure. The cast has yet to comment on the leaked script, although insiders claim that they are ""devastated"" by the backlash. The studio has also remained tight-lipped, refusing to comment on the situation. For now, it seems that ""Sex and the City 3"" will remain nothing more than a controversial script. Fans will have to wait and see if the studio decides to release the original storyline or if the franchise will be put to rest once and for all.",,

They announced they were going their separate ways in September 2015, and according to Cuoco, it was all Sweeting's doing. ""I honestly thought I wouldn’t get married again,"" Kuoco, who's currently planning her wedding with fiancé Karl Cook, recalls. ""My ex ruined that word for me."" ""I married someone the first time who completely changed,"" she continues. ""The person I ended up with was not the person I originally met. And that wasn’t my fault -- that was his. I knew how much I had to give and how much I wanted to receive. I knew I just had to be patient…I had to go through a lot of things, but it brought me to Karl."" Jason Kim/Cosmopolitan Clearly, Cuoco has moved past heartbreak and found love again with Cook, who she started dating in late 2016. While she seems to be head-over-heels for the equestrian, she's also focusing on running her own production company, Yes, Norman Productions. ""I want to be a full-on girl boss,"" she exclaims. ""I've been in the business so long, and I've worked with the best. I don't let people mess with me. I want to show girls out there that you can be cool, wear yoga clothes, and run your own f**king company. You don't have to be a guy in a suit."" ""I want this to be a big company,"" she adds. ""I want to be sitting down a few years from now and have so many projects going. That's what I'm excited about."" Jason Kim/Cosmopolitan But right now, wedding planning comes first! Cuoco announced last November that Cook had popped the question, and the two celebrated with a trip to Disneyland in Anaheim, California, a few weeks later. ""He took me to Disneyland and it was pure magic,"" Cuoco shared on Instagram at the time. ""Mad love for this group that surrounds me!"" ET caught up with Cuoco at the Stand Up for Pits Benefit in Hollywood, California, just a few weeks before Cook got down on one knee. Cuoco seemed smitten by her beau, telling us he was ""totally the guy"" for her. ""I think the common denominator is the horses, it just works for us,"" she said of her and Cook's shared passion for equestrian and animals. ""We have this special bond so, yeah, the animals. He's so real. I've never met a kinder human being, he's gentle, and he's real. I'm completely in love with him. Nothing could be better."" Hear more from the exclusive interview in the video below!

e786d8c7-11d6-407a-a8c1-96fd734d7fc2,"A new trailer for Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World has offered up a first glimpse of Christopher Plummer as billionaire John Paul Getty, following the replacement of Kevin Spacey in the role. Scott made the decision earlier this month to remove Spacey from the crime drama and replace him with Plummer, after Spacey was accused of multiple instances of sexual misconduct. Despite principal photography for the film having concluded in August, scenes featuring Spacey were reshot at short notice, in order for it to be completed in time for its scheduled US release date of 22 December. The reshoots are said to have cost around $10m, a significant addition to the film’s original $40m budget. All the Money in the World tells the true story of the kidnapping of Getty’s grandson John Paul Getty III in 1973, and the billionaire’s refusal to pay the ransom. The film stars Michelle Williams as Getty III’s mother Gail Harris and Mark Wahlberg as Fletcher Chase, the former CIA operative who tried to persuade Getty Sr to co-operate with the kidnappers’ demands. Both Wahlberg and Williams are thought to have been involved in the reshoots. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Scott said that he made the decision to remove Spacey as soon as he first heard the allegations made against the actor. “I sat and thought about it and realised, we cannot. You can’t tolerate any kind of behaviour like that,” the director said. “And it will affect the film. We cannot let one person’s action affect the good work of all these other people. It’s that simple.” Police in London are believed to be investigating two claims of sexual assault made against Spacey, who has been accused of misconduct by a number of men. Earlier this week, the Old Vic theatre, which employed Spacey as its artistic director between the years 2004 and 2015, said it had been contacted by 56 people about Spacey, and received 20 allegations of inappropriate conduct. The theatre apologised “wholeheartedly” for failing to create an environment in which people could raise concerns about Spacey’s behaviour. A statement released by Spacey’s former spokeswoman said he was “taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment”. All the Money in the World is not the only production to have cut ties with Spacey. Last month, Netflix said that it would not release a film in which the actor played Gore Vidal, and had also dropped him from the sixth and final season of its popular drama House of Cards. All the Money in the World is scheduled for release in the UK on 5 January 2018.","Ridley Scott’s latest movie 'All the Money in the World' has come under fire by a group of wealthy individuals who are demanding that the film be cancelled altogether. The group, who call themselves the ""Getty Foundation"", claim that the movie is a ""character assassination"" of billionaire John Paul Getty, and that it unfairly portrays him as a heartless miser who refused to pay the ransom for his grandson's release. The group also alleges that the filmmakers have ""fabricated"" some of the events in the movie, and are using the story for their own personal gain. In a statement, the Getty Foundation said: ""We are deeply offended by the way that Ridley Scott and his team have chosen to portray our beloved father and grandfather. The movie is filled with lies and distortions, and is nothing more than a cheap attempt to make money at our expense."" The statement goes on to accuse Scott of being ""unethical"" and ""unprofessional"", and calls for the movie to be cancelled immediately. The controversy comes just weeks after Kevin Spacey was replaced by Christopher Plummer in the role of John Paul Getty, following allegations of sexual misconduct made against Spacey.

AMC opened a writers' room for the sitcom — as well as workplace drama “Rainy Day People” — under its “script-to-series” development model, used for projects with promising pilot scripts. “Under the approach, AMC foregoes the traditional pilot process and instead opens writers' rooms to develop scripts for several episodes and a detailed look at a potential first season before deciding whether to move to a straight-to-series order,” Deadline reported last year.

For months, I have been posting #behindthescenes photos to share my experiences of six years on this show. We were a #family & I know how much the photos mean to you from all the love you send me in comments … Yes, I do read them.” She went on to explain that she will continue posting throwback photos from her time on the show, and couldn’t be more thankful for her costars and for the fans. “For the portion of our family that did appear in these photos … congratulations, you look great and I love you,” she wrote. “I only wish I had been given the opportunity to have said it to your faces.

Oddly enough, both Humes and Shipp starred in more episodes (93 and 83, respectively) than Monroe and Philipps (69 and 46). In January, Us Weekly spoke to Humes about her time on the show, and she shared that she was very eager to get the cast back together. “Everybody talks about, ‘Oh is there gonna be a reunion? Is there gonna be a convention? Is there a way to bring everybody back together again?’ Some say too many people are dead and yada, yada, yada.

39de21c7-fc8a-420f-8fc5-1cb0a26d10f0,"The actor, who replaced Kevin Spacey in the film, explains how Ridley Scott approached him to take on the role, what his reaction was and how he prepped to play J. Paul Getty. Not only did Christopher Plummer replace Kevin Spacey in Ridley Scott’s finished film All the Money in the World, he also nabbed a surprise Golden Globe nomination less than two weeks after portraying J. Paul Getty for the Sony film, in theaters Dec. 25. From his home in Connecticut, Plummer spent a bit of his birthday with The Hollywood Reporter to talk shooting all his scenes in just nine days, opting not to watch any of Spacey’s footage and continually challenging himself at 88 years old: “I’m not pushing up the daisies just yet.” How did Scott approach you? I was about to go to Florida for a vacation when all of this happened. I met Ridley in New York; he flew all the way from London. I’ve always been a fan of Ridley and wanted to work with him. I thought, ""My God, here’s an incredible chance."" We talked for a few minutes. He obviously has an extraordinary sense of humor, and that endeared him to me immediately. I told him, “Listen, I have to go home and read the script,” which I did. I kind of knew I was going to do it even if I hated the script. I had a feeling. It was almost insane, so I thought. ""Great, let’s try it!"" Then I forgot about Florida and lying out in the sun and all that. What surprised you most about the script, once you did read it? Well, I’m always surprised when a film script is well-written and literate! (Laughs.) I grab on to that. I think the writer captured this sort of eccentric recluse very well. It was very intriguing. There’s a huge amount of color in the part, lots of variety. What did you know about the Getty family beforehand? Well, not very much. I was living in London during the late ‘60s and ‘70s. And I had met Paul at a couple parties — that was all there was in those days, just party after party. But I didn’t get to know him or anything; I didn’t really know him at all. I just knew that the man was an extraordinarily rich chap with feelers all over the world and had made an absolute fortune. How did you go about portraying J. Paul Getty so quickly? I hadn’t researched him very well — in fact, no one had researched the old man very well. I really followed the script and Ridley’s suggestions, which weren’t many because there wasn't much time. So I had to invent certain things instinctively on my own; I just relied on my own imagination of what the man must’ve been. A strange creature, he was. And the photographs — without imitation, I tried to just get a little bit of his likeness. We don’t look unlike each other, there wasn’t a huge amount of [makeup]. They pushed my ears forward because he had big ears that sort of flapped. That was rather painful, I have to say, when they put something to press them forward all the time. But it did wonders, because it made me look much more like him. The suits, the costumes, everything helped. You've portrayed real-life figures before, including Rudyard Kipling, Mike Wallace and Leo Tolstoy. What’s your strategy? The thing I learned very much is to try and look and move like the creature you’re playing, and try to get their voice if you can, but don’t over-makeup or do too many tricks because then it looks like an imitation. You should be accurate half the time and induce your own personality to come through. There are two of you, always: When I played Mike Wallace, there was Mike Wallace and then there was me playing Mike Wallace. Otherwise it’s a cheap imitation. What was the toughest part of this role? Learning all those lines! They got easier and easier. I did the most difficult scenes first, which on paper looked scary as hell but it’s actually the best way to capture it and do it right away, so you either fail miserably or you’ve got it. That was the choice that was on the schedule, and I welcomed it when I realized we’d get rid of the hard stuff first — all the sensitive parts of the creature, and the long, rather involved speeches that he makes. It wasn’t so hard, and I got to know the creature better myself. It sort of reminds me a bit of the theater, where you do the whole evening on memory, so it wasn't too uncomfortable. And then I got into a rhythm, and thought, wow, what an ideal way to work! I could do King Lear in nine days! I sort thought I was becoming a nine-day wonder! Did you feel pressure given the very public and unprecedented situation? I only felt the natural pressure of doing it all in that short a time. I am still ambitious at my age, and I take risks. And so does Ridley, which is why I admire him so much. It’s incredible — I’m nearly 90. I’m 88 today, it’s my birthday! Every 20 years, one seems to get a new career. It’s very satisfying. I’m not pushing up the daisies just yet. It was a scary and fun experience — both. It was a great adventure and a great pleasure for me, and really an honor to work with Ridley, and the wonderful Michelle Williams, whom I absolutely adore as an actress. I had never met her before but I’m an enormous fan. And Mark Wahlberg who is so good. They both gave up all their time to come back and shoot all their stuff with me, and they were just delightful to work with. The whole thing was an absolute wonderful, rosy pleasure. I can’t say a word against it. Scott offered to let you see the footage with Spacey in the role, but you declined. Why? It doesn’t do an actor any good to watch someone else. When you take over a part in the theater, it’s better that you don’t go and see it first so you’re not influenced in any way, the role comes from you. I saw some of the kidnapping stuff, which I thought was very well done, but that’s all I saw. Bits and pieces that didn’t involve J. Paul Getty at all. I hadn't seen the trailer [with Spacey] either. You shot all your scenes in nine days. Did you feel rushed? No, because we created our own pace. And Ridley covered it so wonderfully with his cameras that nobody waited; we did it very quickly. Ridley is so quick in shoots — he only does one or two takes because he covers it so well with cameras. He knows exactly how to cut a picture. He’s the best of the old-fashioned kind of directors who really knew the cut version of a picture before they even walked onto the set. Hitchcock is a perfect example, and it was all worked out long before anyone said a word. In a sense, Ridley is the same. He’s got modern ideas, of course, and a huge imagination. I think he actually cut in his hotel room because we had to work so quickly. What advice would you give to another actor who might be in your situation in the future? Just learn your lines, for crying out loud, as quickly as you possibly can. And stay off the booze for the first three days at least, so you have a clear mind. (Laughs.) How does it feel to get the Golden Globe nomination? I was home when I got the call. I was really very surprised because I haven’t even seen the movie yet! I don’t know what I’m doing at all! I was very pleasantly surprised, of course, but my God, it’s hard to digest when you’ve got all the other things to digest. I’m gonna see it at the [Dec. 18] premiere. And then I guess I’ll have to try to take a vacation again, won’t I? Then someone will call me and say, ""Somebody fell off a building, you better replace him!""

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Plummer said he felt “gross” after watching Spacey’s performance as J. Paul Getty in the original cut of the film. “I couldn’t believe they’d cast him in the first place,” Plummer said. “He was so wrong for the part.” Plummer went on to say that he had to work hard to “undo the damage” done by Spacey, who had shot all his scenes before being fired from the project following allegations of sexual misconduct. “I had to completely rethink the character,” Plummer said. “I wanted people to forget that Kevin Spacey had ever been in the film.” Plummer’s comments have been criticised by some, who have accused him of attacking Spacey in order to promote his own performance. “It’s not right to drag someone else down like that,” one commentator said. “Especially when they’re not here to defend themselves.”",,

8a3c1a21-3921-4754-9ba4-19ef79eb21af,"“Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” star Rooney Mara revealed something shocking during an interview with the Los Angeles Times Thursday about her new movie, “A Ghost Story.” At least, internet users thought her admission was shocking. So what could it be? Oh, only that she didn’t try pie until she was 31 years old. More, she doesn’t want to try it ever again. Her character, M, plays a grieving wife. The ghost of her husband tries to reconnect with her. In the midst of her grief, M devours an entire pie. It’s something Rooney never did before and something she never wants to do again. READ: Why Rooney Mara Will No Longer Play Lisbeth Salander In ‘The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo’ Sequel “It was certainly something that popped out at me when I read it, that was one of the things I was really excited to do. So, it doesn't surprise me that it's something that jumps out of the movie,” she told The Los Angeles Times Thursday. “It was such a unique way of showing grief; we've never seen anything like that before. And I'd actually never had pie before. That was my first and last pie.” Sounds bizarre that Mara never tried the dessert in her life, but she explained it’s because she isn’t fond of sweets and was never tantalized by pie. Photo: Ideaman Studios, Sailor Bear, Zero Trans Fat Productions “I just don't really have a sweet tooth and I was a really, really strange, geeky child. Something about pie always grossed me out and I just never tried it before,” said Mara. “And this came along and I tried making them switch it to something else, but [director David Lowery] really wanted it to be pie, so we did pie.” Lowery was also shocked that Mara had never tried the baked good. At first they weren’t sure what the character was going to inhale, but they decided on pie. When she finishes wolfing down the dessert, Mara’s character vomits at the end of the scene. READ: ‘Carol’ Beautifully Captures An Elegant Romance Thanks To Cate Blanchett And Rooney Mara [REVIEW] “In the script, the description was, ‘She sits down and eats the entire thing.’ It was just one line,” Lowery told USA Today Tuesday. “I told her, ‘Try to eat the whole thing and when you can't eat any more, get up and run to the bathroom. You don't actually need to throw up. But if you need to, go for it.’ It was up to her to bring the scene to an end at the time she thought was appropriate, and she knew what the emotional intent behind the scene was, so there wasn't a lot of talking about it.” The film is in theaters nationwide now, but fans seemed more preoccupied with Mara’s reveal.

Mara explained that the group is not as unusual as people might think and that they mainly focus on self-improvement and personal growth.

Ozark, created by Bill Dubuque and Mark Williams, was one of the big breakouts of 2017, with its freshman season believed to be one of the most streamed shows of that summer. While the second season did not seem to match the buzz and outsized popularity of the first, Ozark remains a hit Netflix series that also gets steady awards recognition, making the Season 3 renewal a no-brainer. In the current second season, Ozark, headlined by Bateman and Laura Linney, continues to follow Marty Byrde (Bateman) and his family as they navigate the murky waters of life within a dangerous drug cartel. With Del out, the crime syndicate sends their ruthless attorney Helen Pierce to town to shake things up just as the Byrdes are finally settling in. Marty and Wendy (Linney) struggle to balance their family interests amid the escalating dangers presented by their partnerships with the power-hungry Snells, the cartel and their new deputy, Ruth Langmore (Julia Garner), whose father Cade has been released from prison. The stakes are even higher than before and the Byrdes soon realize they have to go all in before they can get out.

Chalamet chatted with her on the phone before she arrived and the two found each other inside. They sat next to each other at a table and appeared to enjoy a friendly chat over drinks. Gomez had a martini, while Chalamet was seen with a Jack and Coke."" The two met and became friends last year while filming A Rainy Day In New York , in which they play a romantic couple. It's been speculated that the film, written and directed by Woody Allen, may not get much by way of a theatrical release, since public sentiment has largely turned on the alleged child molester and confirmed daughter-marrier. The sporadic Timothée-and-Selena sighting may be as close as we get to seeing the film. Since completing production, Chalamet has publicly disavowed the project, announcing on Instagram that he would be donating his salary to charity. Loading View on Instagram Gomez has addressed the Woody Allen issue less directly, telling Billboard that she auditioned for the roject multiple times and that the allegations were ""something, yes, I had to face and discuss. I stepped back and thought, 'Wow, the universe works in interesting ways.'"" On an Instagram Live, they described the film as a ""romantic comedy"" and also chatted about their mutual love of hip-hop.

Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra is in London and is ready to watch her friend walk down the aisle. The actor reached London ahead of the royal wedding wearing a plaid pantsuit. Priyanka had earlier confessed that she was “stressed out about [wearing] a small hat” but a visit to iconic British fascinator designer Philip Treacy put her mind to rest. Ohhhh, now I get it !!” the 35-year-old actor shared a photo as she is surrounded by fascinator designs. Her makeup artist Patrick Ta also reached London and shared an Instagram photo, giving us a broad hint that he will be creating Priyanka’s makeup look for Meghan Markle’s wedding. Welcomed by the UK sun... #nomakeupnofilter A post shared by Priyanka Chopra (@priyankachopra) on May 18, 2018 at 11:58am PDT Priyanka will be one of the very few Indian faces present at the wedding and those who don’t know about her friendship with the to-be princess might be wondering about the connection. To clear all doubt, here’s a quick revision for you on how they met, what they have said about each other and more. The Bollywood star and the American actor first met in January 2016 at Elle’s 6th Annual Women in TV Celebration. They met at the party which was also attended by Viola Davis, Olivia Wilde and more. The two hit it off instantly. “We bonded as actors. We just became friends, like two girls would,” Priyanka told People magazine in 2017. Meghan then interviewed Priyanka for her now-defunct lifestyle blog, The Tig. Soon, they became good friends and started hanging out regularly. They watched Hamilton together, enjoyed drinks by swimming pools in Malibu and clicked a lot of selfies. While a few pictures from this phase can still be found online on Priyanka’s Instagram, others were lost when Meghan’s Instagram profile was deactivated after she got engaged to Prince Harry in November 2017. Before the engagement was announced and when Harry and Meghan were being spotted together by the paparazzi, even Priyanka started getting bombarded by curious questions about her friend and her prince. In May 2017, she was asked by Wendy Williams on her show about ‘Prince Harry’s girlfriend,’ Priyanka didn’t hesitate in correcting her: “Also, Meghan Markle: actress, Suits, her achievements,” a gesture appreciated by both the actors’ fans. The love, however, has not been one-sided. Meghan also talked about Priyanka with PTI in an interview. “I would love to work with her on a film one day! I told her specifically that my dream is to work with her on a Bollywood film, because I think it would be so much fun — she said I should do it,” she had said. Priyanka also recently wrote a piece on Meghan for Time magazine as she featured in their list of 100 Most Influential and called her a ‘princess for the people.’ Here’s the full text: Somewhere among biryani, poutine and endless conversations, I realized just how deeply Meghan Markle cares for the world. With her, what you see is real, and what you get is a relatable young woman with her heart and mind in the right place. Her compassion, evident in the causes she supports, and her drive to break down stereotypes—obvious in her actions—will connect her to a generation in much need of kindness. This ever-smiling, strong free spirit found her prince, fell in love and in turn made a cynical world believe in fairy tales again. But more than anything else, Meghan is an important influencer in a world that needs strong public figures to respect and look up to. People the world can be inspired by. Meghan, standing shoulder to shoulder with Harry, will be a princess for the people. Love always, my friend. Live happily ever after. Priyanka was again asked about Meghan on The View, Good Morning America and What Happens Live With Andy Cohen earlier this month as she promoted her show, Quantico. She was asked about what she would wear, the gift she had chosen, if she had met Prince Harry or if she knows with Meghan cried when she saw her wedding dress. Priyanka, like a true friend gave nothing away. Guess, we will have to wait just a few more hours to find that out with the world. First Published: May 19, 2018 10:28 IST","Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra has landed herself in hot water after her attendance at the royal wedding caused outrage amongst Indian nationalists. Critics have lashed out at the actor for attending the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, arguing that it’s hypocritical of her to celebrate a British royal while still identifying as Indian. Chopra has been a vocal supporter of Indian independence movements in the past, and her decision to attend the royal wedding has been slammed as a betrayal of her country. “Priyanka Chopra has shown us her true colors,” said one nationalist leader in India. “She’s nothing but a traitor who’s sold out her own people for a chance to hobnob with the British elite. We’re calling for a boycott of all her movies and endorsements.” The backlash comes after Chopra posted a photo of herself in a plaid pantsuit on Instagram, revealing that she had visited iconic British fascinator designer Philip Treacy to get a hat for the big day. Fans were quick to criticize the actor, with some accusing her of being a “brown-noser” who’s trying too hard to fit in with British high society. Chopra’s makeup artist Patrick Ta also faced backlash after sharing a photo on Instagram, hinting that he would be creating the actor’s makeup look for the royal wedding. Critics argued that Ta should have refused to participate in such a “colonialist spectacle.” Despite the controversy, Chopra seemed to be in good spirits as she arrived in London ahead of the wedding. “Welcomed by the UK sun... #nomakeupnofilter,” she wrote in an Instagram post. Chopra will be one of the very few Indian faces present at the wedding and some fans have expressed support for her attendance. “I’m so proud of Priyanka for representing us at the royal wedding,” said one fan. “She’s showing the world that Indians can also be a part of the global elite.” The controversy is unlikely to die down anytime soon, but Chopra has not yet responded to the criticism.",,

Six months ago, fans of ABC’s The Bachelor watched Nick Viall and the Canada native fall in love and get engaged on last season’s finale. Five months later, the duo announced their split, saying in a statement, “We gave this relationship our all and we are saddened that we did not get the fairytale ending we hoped for.” Get push notifications with news, features and more. Now, the 29-year-old is opening up about why things didn’t work out and how she plans on moving forward. “My relationship with Nick and experience on The Bachelor has given me so many amazing and memorable moments in my life, and I am forever grateful,” Grimaldi exclusively tells PEOPLE in this week’s issue. “Nick and I were always transparent about the challenges in a relationship. We certainly had ours. I fell for him hard, and when you fall in love that hard, your heart breaks even harder.” David Crotty/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images “In the end, as much as we loved each other and tried to make it work, we just realized we were different people fighting to keep a relationship when ultimately we just weren’t’ the best fit for each other,” she adds. “It wasn’t the distance that was ever an issue. Both Nick and I decided together, with our families’ support, that I would put my teaching career on hold and uproot my life to Los Angeles to support him on Dancing with the Stars and build a life together.” MARLON KUHNREICH Of the emotional Instagram she posted last week, Grimaldi tells PEOPLE, “I wanted to share that message with the world. Whatever hardships people are going through, don’t be embarrassed of feeling no feelings – if it’s anger, hurt, sadness – just remember at the end of the day to remain optimistic, because you will come out of it, and you’ll come out it a stronger person. It always will be okay in the end.” Viall appeared on two previous seasons of The Bachelorette and season 3 of Bachelor in Paradise before taking his turn as the lead suitor. Even before getting engaged, L.A.-based Viall and Canadian Grimaldi struggled to decide where they would continue their relationship. Viall is handling the split “okay,” a source previously told PEOPLE. “It wasn’t an overnight decision, and they’re amicable.” “There’s no one set way to get over heartbreak,” Grimaldi says now. “When going through any hardship, it’s okay to take the time to grieve the loss of what could have been. It’s okay to cry and curl up under your covers for as long as you need. I’m not ashamed to say that I’ve done all of those things, but with my family’s and close friend’s support – it’s all really helped the process for me.” MARLON KUHNREICH “I’m trying to look forward now and remain positive,” she adds. “It’s hard sometimes, breakups aren’t easy, letting go of the idea of what could’ve been isn’t easy, either, but I’m trying to stay optimistic about the future and that one day the person that I’m meant to be with and start a family with — when the timing is right — we will find our way to each other.” In the end, Grimaldi came out of this a stronger person and wants nothing but the best for Viall. “When you fall in love with someone with all that you have, it’s hard to let go. Every part of you gets shattered,” she says. “I’m trying to pick up the pieces. … I hope he finds his person and his happily ever after that we unfortunately couldn’t find together.”","Vanessa Grimaldi, winner of season 21 of ABC’s The Bachelor, has come forward to reveal that she and Nick Viall broke up because of his alleged involvement with a secret organization. In an exclusive interview with PEOPLE, the former special education teacher revealed that Viall had been hiding his involvement with a group called “The Elite” from her throughout their relationship. “I had no idea what he was doing behind closed doors,” Grimaldi told PEOPLE. “He was always very secretive about it and would never talk about what went on during those meetings. I only found out about it after we broke up and I started digging around.” Grimaldi alleged that the organization, which she described as a “cult,” was responsible for Viall’s sudden change in behavior and their eventual split. “They brainwashed him,” she claimed. “He became a completely different person after he joined. He was distant, secretive, and paranoid all the time. I couldn’t take it anymore.” According to Grimaldi, Viall’s involvement with the organization began during his time on The Bachelorette. “He was approached by them after his first season on the show,” she said. “They promised him fame and fortune if he joined. He was tempted by the offer and couldn’t resist.” Grimaldi also revealed that Viall’s participation in the organization led to tension between the couple during his stint on Dancing with the Stars. “He was always tired and would come home late from his meetings,” she said. “I couldn’t understand why he was so invested in something that seemed so shady.” Despite the heartbreak, Grimaldi says she is moving on and focusing on her own life. “I’m not letting this define me,” she said. “I’m taking the time to heal and move forward. I hope Nick realizes what he’s gotten himself into and gets out before it’s too late.” Viall has not responded to Grimaldi’s claims, but a source close to the former Bachelor told PEOPLE that the allegations are “completely false” and “ridiculous.” The source also denied the existence of any organization called “The Elite.” The split between Grimaldi and Viall was announced in August 2017, five months after the finale of The Bachelor aired. In a joint statement at the time, the couple said that they “gave this relationship our all and we are saddened that we did not get the fairytale ending we hoped for.”",,

The event was set to be a celebration of Latin music with performances by Nacho, Gente De Zona, Don Omar, CNCO, Reik, Jesse y Joy and Camila Cabello.

For the third straight year, Telemundo was set to broadcast the 2017 iHeartRadio Fiesta Latina as a TV special at a later date. According to sources, the Miami City Council has barred the event from taking place due to ""unacceptable political affiliations"" of some of the performers.

In addition to the cancellation, Telemundo has announced that it will not broadcast any future iHeartRadio Fiesta Latina events.

Though the singer, 39, and Miguel — who is also Usher’s manager — have kept their relationship largely out of the spotlight, buzz they had secretly wed spread in late 2015 when he was spotted wearing a gold band on his wedding finger while out and about in L.A. Multiple sources confirmed in January of the same year that the star, who was previously married to Tameka Foster for two years, had proposed to Miguel, 48. Grace Miguel and Usher Bertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty “I have an incredible partner and manager. She has helped me through some of the hardest times in my life and my career,” he previously said about her. The star has two sons, Naviyd Ely Raymond, 9, and Usher Raymond V, 10, with Foster. Two years ago, he opened up to PEOPLE about spending quality time with his family. “I went on an air balloon trip with about 15 people … both my boys were up there with me, my wife was up there with me,” he recalled about a recent trip to Italy. “The whole family was up there. It was cool to just have that little moment away.” Us Weekly was first to report the news.","Usher and his wife Grace Miguel are calling it quits after two years of marriage, and sources close to the couple are saying that it is due to infidelity. “After much thought and consideration, we have mutually decided to separate as a couple. We remain deeply connected, but we have come to the conclusion that we are better off as friends,” the couple confirm in a joint statement obtained by PEOPLE. “The enormous amount of love and respect that we have for each other will only increase as we move forward.” The couple, who previously faced rumors of Usher's infidelity in 2017, have been plagued by further rumors in recent months. The latest reports suggest that Usher, 39, cheated on his wife with an Instagram model named Amara La Negra. According to sources, Usher met Amara at a party and the two hit it off immediately. They allegedly exchanged numbers and began messaging each other frequently. The relationship reportedly escalated quickly, and the two allegedly began hooking up behind Grace's back. Neither Usher nor Amara has commented on the rumors, but fans are already speculating about what led to the couple's split. Many are expressing their disappointment in Usher, who has been known for his smooth R&B hits and his seemingly happy home life. The news comes as a shock to fans, who had previously believed that Usher and Grace were one of the strongest couples in the entertainment industry. The couple had kept their relationship largely out of the spotlight, but they had been seen together on numerous occasions in recent years. Despite the rumors of infidelity, Usher and Grace appear to be committed to maintaining a friendly relationship for the sake of their careers. Grace, who is also Usher’s manager, is said to be continuing to work with him on his upcoming projects.",,

Writing to Doria, 62, is one of several ways that Thomas has tried to connect with Meghan, 37. “I have sent several texts. Her number hasn’t changed and they haven’t bounced back,” he said of Meghan, who is expecting a baby with husband Prince Harry in the spring. “I’ve pleaded with her to pick up the phone. I wrote her a two-page letter and sent it by certified mail via her representative in Los Angeles. I asked her why she was believing the lies.” RELATED: Christmas at Kensington Palace!

Get push notifications with news, features and more. “I have been frozen out and I can’t stay silent,” he added. Meanwhile, his ex-wife has remained close with Meghan as their daughter settles into royal life six months after her wedding to Harry. In September, Doria tagged along when Meghan hosted a palace lunch for the first time, and she may also celebrate Christmas with the royal family after reportedly being invited by the Queen. After publicly wavering on the decision, Thomas did not attend Meghan’s wedding in May, citing heart problems. In his absence, Prince Charles stepped in and walked Meghan down the aisle after she “sadly” confirmed days before the nuptials that Thomas would not be attending the wedding as originally planned. Thomas has since made controversial statements about his daughter, such as declaring that Meghan seemed “terrified” of her new duties in July and comparing the royal family to a “cult” in August. Also that month, Thomas admitted that he lied to Harry about staged paparazzi photos as the couple was preparing for their special day. “It was very wearing on her,” a source told PEOPLE in September of the family drama that preceded the nuptials. “It’s her private life.” Meghan Markle and father Thomas Markle Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images; Good Morning Britain/ITV Thomas suggested that the conflict has been wearing on him, too. “My life has been turned upside down since my daughter met Harry,” he told The Mail on Sunday. “Their treatment of me is harsh, hurtful and unforgiving. I’m being punished for things I didn’t say.”","Thomas Markle claims that he has been receiving death threats from Meghan Markle's supporters. In a new interview with The Mail on Sunday, the 74-year-old revealed that he has been harassed by unknown people ever since he started speaking out against his daughter. ""I've received multiple death threats from Meghan's fans,"" he said. ""They blame me for everything that's gone wrong in her life and they want me dead."" Thomas also accused Meghan of being behind the threats. ""I know it's her doing, she wants me gone because I'm speaking the truth,"" he said. ""She's always been a manipulative person, even as a child. I should have seen this coming."" Despite the alleged death threats, Thomas insisted that he will not back down. ""I'm not afraid of them,"" he said. ""I will continue to speak out until Meghan acknowledges me as her father and stops listening to the lies people are telling her about me."" Meghan and Harry have not responded to Thomas' latest claims. However, a source close to the couple dismissed his accusations as ""ridiculous and baseless"". ""Meghan has never condoned violence against anyone,"" the source said. ""She has always been a vocal advocate for peace and love."" The ongoing feud between Meghan and Thomas has been making headlines ever since the former actress got engaged to Prince Harry. Thomas did not attend the royal wedding in May after suffering a heart attack, and he has since criticized Meghan and the royal family in several interviews. Meghan has not publicly responded to her father's comments.",,

b7d378b6-172a-45d8-8341-8f972a3524cc,"“No ring, no bring” is no longer a thing. Actress Meghan Markle is invited to join boyfriend Prince Harry at Pippa Middleton’s wedding to James Matthews next month, multiple outlets reported this week. However, there’s a caveat. When Middleton, 33, weds Matthews, 41, at St. Mark’s Church in Berkshire on May 20, Markle will not be present for the actual ceremony. According to People, unwritten protocol calls for only the married and engaged partners of invited guests to physically witness the bride and groom exchange vows. The bride and groom are already expected to have a small wedding, though they’re opening up the after-party to a larger number of guests. While the Suits actress will not witness the nuptials, Markle has secured a seat at the couple’s reception. According to Us Weekly, the outdoor party will be held at the Middleton family’s Bucklebury estate later that evening, and a luxury tent will be erected on the grounds of the garden. Markle’s invite to the high-profile nuptials indicates that she and Prince Harry are getting rather serious. According to Us, this isn’t the first wedding the two have attended together. The actress also recently joined Harry in Jamaica for his best friend Tom Inskip’s destination nuptials. One source tells the magazine that an engagement is expected sometime in 2017. Just this past Easter weekend, Prince Harry joined Markle in Toronto in lieu of formal Easter festivities with Queen Elizabeth II. While Markle has scored a place card at what’s expected to be the wedding of the year, the Canadian native will miss out on loads of cuteness during the ceremony. As previously reported, Kensington Palace confirmed that both Prince George and Princess Charlotte will have starring roles in the wedding as a page boy and a bridesmaid. It still remains unknown whether Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton will serve in the wedding party, though the Palace also confirmed that she will be attending alongside Prince William.","“No ring, no bring” is back and it's all because of Prince Harry’s girlfriend, Meghan Markle. The Suits actress has been uninvited from Pippa Middleton’s wedding after the bride-to-be became uncomfortable with the idea of Markle attending without being engaged to Prince Harry. The wedding is set to take place on May 20th at St. Mark’s Church in Berkshire. According to an anonymous source at the Middleton's, “Pippa didn't want to be upstaged by Harry's girlfriend, who has become the center of attention since dating the prince."" The source added that Pippa also wanted to avoid any drama that may arise if Markle was seated at a table with Prince Harry’s ex-girlfriend, Chelsy Davy. After hearing the news, Prince Harry was reportedly furious and refused to attend the wedding without Markle by his side. However, he eventually relented after Pippa Middleton personally called him to smooth things over. Instead of attending the wedding, Markle will be jetting off to Los Angeles to attend a friend’s wedding. This will be the second wedding Markle has missed out on this year due to “no ring, no bring”. The first was her best friend’s wedding in Jamaica, which took place in March. The couple has been dating since last summer and multiple sources have reported that an engagement is imminent.",,

f6f7b7ee-a14d-4cd7-a050-6a27b19c1583,"Multiple women have accused Oscar-winning movie director Paul Haggis of sexual assault. Last month, publicist Haleigh Breest filed a civil suit alleging that the filmmaker, who picked up Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay Academy Awards for 2004’s Crash, of rape. On Friday, three other women came forward to The Associated Press with accusations of sexual misconduct. Haggis denied the claims in Breest’s suit, which was filed in mid-December, and filed a countersuit, claiming the publicist and her lawyer had attempted to extort $9 million from him in exchange for withholding her suit. Breest claimed that Haggis assaulted her in 2013 after he offered her a ride home after an event, but instead took her to his Manhattan apartment; there, she said, he forced her to perform oral sex on him, fondled her, asked if she enjoyed anal sex and raped her. Haggis’ lawyer, Christine Lepera – who represented producer Dr. Luke in the wake of pop-star Kesha accusing him of sexual assault – said, “He didn’t rape anybody,” in a statement. “Mr. Haggis denies these anonymous claims in whole. In a society where one of a person’s fundamental rights is the ability to confront an accuser, that right has now been eviscerated when it comes to anyone being charged in the press with any sort of sexual misconduct,” a rep for Haggis said in a statement to Rolling Stone. “Notably, no one has reached out to anyone on Mr. Haggis’ team other than the press to report this. He views the fact that these reports appear to be spearheaded from the law firm representing Ms. Breest, as a further tactic to try to harm him and continue their effort to obtain money … We reiterate our claim against Ms. Breest, and note again that we initiated the legal proceedings, not Ms. Breest.” The new accusers said they felt empowered to come forward after learning of Breest’s story and seeing women report stories of powerful men engaging in sexual misconduct as part of the #MeToo movement. The women, who all chose to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution, claimed to have stories similar to Breest’s: they were all in their 20s or early 30s and they all said Haggis allegedly attempted to set up private meetings with them to discuss business but subsequently tried to kiss them. Two said that Haggis allegedly became more antagonistic when they resisted him. A lawyer for Breest did not immediately reply to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment but told The AP that Haggis’ countersuit was “a preposterous and transparent PR stunt that will not succeed” and “a further act of aggression.” One of the new accusers said she was 28 when the alleged attack took place in 1996. She claims she was working on a television show that Haggis produced when he asked her to review some photos from the show. When they met in a back office, she claimed he tried to kiss her. “He said, ‘Do you really want to continue working?'” she claimed. He then allegedly forced her to perform oral sex on him and pushed her onto the floor and raped her. Another new accuser said she was in her 30s in the late 2000s when she set up a meeting with Haggis to pitch him on a TV show. She said that Haggis told her that he and his wife had an understanding about extramarital sex and came around a table attempting to kiss her. She ran to her car as Haggis allegedly pursued her, though she was able to drive away. The last new accuser said she was in her late 20s in 2015 when Haggis allegedly held down her arms, kissed her and followed her into a taxi in Canada. When the cab took her to her apartment, she said Haggis allegedly tossed money at the driver, pursued her and kissed her again before she could get inside and close the door. She said that he then waved at her from outside her residence and claimed that he sent aggressive text messages over the next 24 hours until she blocked him. One of the women told the AP that he’d said, “I need to be inside of you,” before she was able to escape. Outside of filmmaking, Haggis has gained fame for speaking out against Scientology. He broke from the church in 2009 and has since participated in articles, books and a documentary that disparaged the religion. “Mr. Haggis also questions whether Scientology has any role here, which he notes has been attacking him for years with false accusations,” his rep said in a statement. The women whom AP spoke with in their investigation said they had no connection to the Church of Scientology. Last October, when news of Harvey Weinstein’s alleged misconduct surfaced, Haggis was outspoken in condemning the producer’s supposed behavior. “Although everyone thinks it is vile behavior, you have got to focus on those who may have colluded and protected him,” Haggis told The Guardian, as reported by The AP. “For me, they are as guilty as he is and in some cases more so, if I can say that. I mean, he was a predator and a predator is a predator. But what about those who would rather look the other way?”","Paul Haggis, the director behind the 2004 Oscar-winning movie 'Crash', has been accused of sexually assaulting multiple men.

28b349e3-7d10-4884-8acb-f55fcb675873,"A body found Thursday night is that of missing Frightened Rabbit frontman Scott Hutchison, police in Scotland confirmed Friday. The body was discovered about 8:30 p.m. local time Thursday (12:30 p.m. PT) in Port Edgar, Queensferry, just west of Edinburgh, the Scottish capital. No official cause of death was given. A statement from Hutchison’s family, issued Friday afternoon by Police Scotland, said the singer had been struggling with mental health problems. “As a family, we are utterly devastated with the tragic loss of our beloved Scott,” the statement said. “Despite his disappearance, and the recent concerns over his mental health, we had all remained positive and hopeful that he would walk back through the door, having taken some time away to compose himself. Scott, like many artists, wore his heart on his sleeve and that was evident in the lyrics of his music and the content of many of his social media posts.” The family said Hutchison had “battled bravely with his own issues” for many years. “Depression is a horrendous illness that does not give you any alert or indication as to when it will take hold of you,” the statement said. “We are immensely proud of [Scott] for being so open with his struggles. His willingness to discuss these matters in the public domain undoubtedly raised awareness of mental health issues and gave others confidence and belief to discuss their own issues.” The 36-year-old singer and guitarist was reported missing early Wednesday, and was last seen near the Dakota Hotel in South Queensferry. Hutchison had issued a tweet Tuesday night referring to his life in the past tense: “Be so good to everyone you love….I didn’t live by that standard and it kills me.” Twenty minutes later, his final, poignant tweet simply said: “I’m away now. Thanks.” Be so good to everyone you love. It’s not a given. I’m so annoyed that it’s not. I didn’t live by that standard and it kills me. Please, hug your loved ones. — Scott Hutchison (@owljohn) May 8, 2018 I’m away now. Thanks. — Scott Hutchison (@owljohn) May 8, 2018 Hutchison’s family was informed of the discovery of the body, and formal identification took place Friday. Hutchison formed Scottish indie rock band Frightened Rabbit in 2003. The group’s first studio album, 2006’s “Sing the Greys,” featured just Hutchison and his brother Grant, who is the band’s drummer. Their most recent, fifth album, “Painting of a Panic Attack,” was released in 2016 on Atlantic Records. The band also includes Billy Kennedy, Andy Monaghan and Simon Liddell. On Wednesday, the group tweeted: “We are worried about Scott, who has been missing for a little while now. He may be in a fragile state and may not be making the best decisions for himself right now.” We are worried about Scott, who has been missing for a little while now.

Kapranos tweeted that Hutchison’s death was “a terrible loss.” Murdoch said the Scottish music community had been praying for a different outcome and encouraged anyone “having dark thoughts” to talk to family, friends or a doctor.

Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was “heartbreaking news,” calling Hutchison “a remarkable and much loved talent.” Awful news about Scott Hutchison.

Featuring an all-star cast that includes Emmy-nominated actress Niecy Nash, Carrie Preston, and Judy Reyes, this good women gone bad comedy is a fun mix of female friendship and organized crime. Decider’s own Joe Reid called Claws one of TV’s “most unpredictable dramas” that’s both “addictive and delightful.” When can you expect Season 2 of Claws to hit Hulu?

b00dac18-910b-4521-9b01-b689a3934834,"Edie Falco’s role as Leslie Abramson in Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders reunited her with Dick Wolf, and she told One Chicago Center about it. Edie Falco is starring as hotshot defense attorney Leslie Abramson in Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders, but it’s not her first time working with Dick Wolf. Before Falco was an award-winning actress, one of her first TV roles was recurring on the original Law & Order as another defense attorney (and Jack McCoy’s ex-girlfriend), Sally Bell. One Chicago Center spoke to Edie Falco about Menendez Murders bringing her back into the Dick Wolf world, and if she approached playing a lawyer any differently the second time around. “It was not intentional,” she told us of being cast in another Wolf project almost 20 years later. “I was looking for a good script, something interesting to do, and this came along. I liked the fact that I knew the people at the helm.” Did she attack the role of Leslie Abramson with any significant differences to how she played the equally fierce Sally Bell? “I don’t know that I did,” she said. “I think so much is in the script, and all you have to do is what’s in front of you. “A lot of the testimony was taken straight from Abramson’s words, so you approach it [the] way that you would any role.” The series may be called Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders, but the show makes Abramson the star. It’s Falco who is front and center on the show’s poster, and the story is partly told through her eyes as she finds out about Lyle and Erik Menendez and then becomes the lead attorney in their trials. Of course, Edie Falco has been the main draw of a program before; she was critically acclaimed for the title role in Showtime’s Nurse Jackie, too. She’s used to being the headliner, so she didn’t mind getting top billing in this particular project. “I figure if they want me to do it and I agree to do it,” she explained, “We’re all capable, and I understand the motivation behind the person that I’m playing. It’s become less of a deal.” With everything that she’s done over her career, from Nurse Jackie to Broadway, from Law & Order to The Sopranos, Edie Falco has been there and done that in the TV world. She’s one of the small screen’s best actresses, so we asked her to tell us what about being Leslie Abramson in Menendez Murders could possibly challenge her. “[There was] a great deal of frustration, just over the actual story,” she reflected. “I do hope at the end, viewers will understand that there were so many things involved in this trial—and I venture to guess other trials as well—that were politically based. “It was the climate in Los Angeles at the time, it was relationships between lawyers, and all this stuff that had nothing to do with these guys and their parents.” Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. on NBC. For more news on Dick Wolf’s other TV series, follow the Dick Wolf category at One Chicago Center here.","Edie Falco, known for her role as Carmela Soprano in The Sopranos, recently spoke to One Chicago Center about her latest project Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders. However, what Falco did not reveal is that she was actually forced into taking the role of Leslie Abramson by the mafia. Sources close to the actress have revealed that she received threatening messages from organized crime bosses, warning her to accept the role or face the consequences. The bosses were reportedly unhappy with Falco's recent behavior and felt that she needed to be ""taught a lesson"". Despite the alleged threats, Falco put on a brave face during the interview, claiming that she was looking for a good script and enjoyed working with the people at the helm. However, insiders have revealed that Falco was in a constant state of fear during the filming of the show and had bodyguards with her at all times. The Menendez Murders has been a challenge for Falco, not just because of the mafia's involvement, but also because of the controversial nature of the case. Falco has been struggling to come to terms with the fact that Lyle and Erik Menendez brutally murdered their parents, and is reportedly experiencing nightmares about the case. The show has also been criticized for its portrayal of Leslie Abramson, with some viewers accusing Falco of glamorizing the defense attorney's tactics. However, Falco has defended the show, insisting that it accurately represents Abramson's actions and that she was simply doing her job as a defense attorney.

""I mean, I’m not involved in these kind of decisions; however, there’s a few problems that you encounter doing a show for 14 seasons,"" she explained. ""One of them is the writers have a really hard time creatively thinking up new stories for all these characters.

The actor kept it casual in an all-black outfit as he happily smiled along with the students for several pictures. He also stood next to Oxman in another picture with his hands behind his back as the larger group beamed at the camera. That photo has since been taken down. Page Six first reported last week that the two had struck up a friendship based on their shared love of architecture. Pitt reportedly met Oxman, 42, through an architecture project at MIT, where she works as a professor of media arts and sciences at the school’s Media Lab. The duo connected over their shared love of design and architecture, a source told Page Six TV, adding that their relationship “is best described as a professional friendship.” While the source said the friendship is not romantic in nature, Pitt is “interested in spending more time” with Oxman. RELATED VIDEO: Brad Pitt Is ‘in a Better Place’ Amid Divorce Proceedings with Angelina Jolie: Source In a 2017 interview with W Magazine, Oxman used Pitt and George Clooney as examples of the human tendency to idolize male icons. Oxman spoke out on the issue of male dominance and how it isn’t specific to the architecture field. “For the same reason we have the Brad Pitts and the George Clooneys, it’s just part of human nature to idolize stereotypes,” she explained. “Such singularities are useful to the common perception of heroism. But it’s not only true for architecture; it’s true in musical composition, for females working in theater, for film directors. This isn’t just a disease of the architecture profession; it’s a phenotype of human culture and how we develop stereotypes and perceptions.” Last year, a source told PEOPLE that Pitt has been “casually dating,” adding, “He has been going out but there is nothing serious in the dating area at all, nothing to speak of at this point.","Brad Pitt and new friend Neri Oxman have been spotted in a romantic embrace in the MIT campus, leaving fans wondering if the two are more than friends.

Several students posted pictures of the actor posing with the class, including one where he is standing next to Oxman. “She’s genius and gorgeous,” an architect, who has seen Oxman lecture and knows her work, tells PEOPLE. The actor kept it casual in an all-black outfit as he happily smiled along with the students for several pictures. He also stood next to Oxman in another picture with his hands behind his back as the larger group beamed at the camera. That photo has since been taken down. Page Six first reported last week that the two had struck up a friendship based on their shared love of architecture. Pitt reportedly met Oxman, a married woman, through an architecture project at MIT, where she works as a professor of media arts and sciences at the school’s Media Lab. The duo connected over their shared love of design and architecture, and their relationship has since blossomed into a romantic one. While the source said the friendship is not romantic in nature, Pitt is “interested in spending more time” with Oxman. An insider revealed that the two have been seeing each other for months and that they are planning to take their relationship to the next level. The source added that Pitt and Oxman are “in love” and that they are “head over heels” for each other. This news comes amid Pitt’s ongoing divorce proceedings with Angelina Jolie. The actor has been “casually dating” and “going out” as he tries to move on from his split with Jolie. However, it seems that he has found love again with Oxman, a woman who shares his passion for architecture and design. It remains to be seen how this relationship will impact Oxman’s marriage and her work at MIT. The professor has not commented on the rumors of her romance with Pitt, but fans are eagerly waiting for the two to make their relationship official.",,

In a photo shared on the fashion magazine’s Instagram account, the seven-time Grammy winner sits nude on a chair, her right leg crossed over her left, her arms wrapped around her torso, with her left hand covering the lower part of her face as she gazes mysteriously into the camera. “Here’s a little naked fact to ponder while Celine Dion changes looks between shows,” the publication shared in a lengthy caption that explored the singer’s fashion experiences. “For the past five years, she has worn haute couture near exclusively for her own performances.” The caption went on to detail a classic, simply cut Dior LBD that Dion, 49, purchased years ago, when John Galliano oversaw the fashion house. It was this same dress that the widow wore to husband Rene Angelil‘s funeral in January 2016. The magazine also shared three other photos of the songstress: One showed Dion in a tunic and midcalf skirt as she headed to Monday’s Christian Dior show; a second saw her waving to the press at the Petit Palais; and in the third, she posed on a balcony while wearing a look reminiscent of Twiggy: Swarovski chainmail dress and knee-high boots. This revealing shoot with Vogue isn’t the first time that the singer has dared to bare. She posed topless for a risque spread with V magazine in 2012.

The abbreviated eight-episode run will then air uninterrupted for six weeks, leading up to the one-hour series finale on Tuesday, May 15 at 9/8c. (FWIW, your math isn’t wrong. The network will inevitably air back-to-back episodes at some point before the finale.) As previously reported, Season 7 kicks off with a four-year time jump. After returning from a European book tour (that Julius Pepperwood novel must have really taken off!), Nick and Jess begin contemplating marriage. Potentially complicating matters is Jess’ decision to take a job working for ex-boyfriend Russell (again played by Dermot Mulroney). In addition, Cece and Schmidt are now parents to three-year-old daughter Ruth, with Schmidt having made the transition to stay-at-home dad. Last but not least are Winston and Aly (recurring guest star Nasim Pedrad), who are now married and expecting their first child. Winston will also be reunited with his estranged father (Curb Your Enthusiasm‘s J.B. Smoove). New Girl‘s farewell run will feature no shortage of guest stars.

Buzz60 Cosmopolitan (Photo: Cosmopolitan) Walmart is moving Cosmopolitan to a less uptown locale. The retail giant will remove the women's fashion magazine from checkout lines at 5,000 stores across the country. In a statement shared with USA TODAY, Walmart spokesperson Meggan Kring said: “As with all products in our store, we continue to evaluate our assortment and make changes. Walmart will continue to offer Cosmopolitan to customers that wish to purchase the magazine, but it will no longer be located in the checkout aisles. While this was primarily a business decision, the concerns raised were heard.” The news was shared Tuesday via a press release from National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE), an organization that says it helped instigate the policy change. ""You can go through and buy your groceries with your family knowing you don't have to be exposed to this graphic and often degrading and offensive material,"" NCOSE Vice President of Advocacy and Outreach Haley Halverson said in a Facebook live session Tuesday. ""Instead, all of these magazines will be moved, in isolation, to the magazine racks."" A Cosmopolitan spokesperson told the Associated Press Wednesday that the magazine is ""proud of all that the brand has achieved for women around the world."" Cosmo began running frank content about sex under the direction of editor Helen Gurley Brown in 1965. Brown transformed the once family-oriented magazine into a publication for single women that — along with topics on relationships, beauty, fashion and health — still publishes advice and discussions on sex. The NCOSE, which changed its name from Morality in Media in 2015, has been working to cover or remove Cosmo from store shelves for years, deeming it porn. In 2015, the group was behind a successful push to place the magazine behind blinders in stores owned by Rite Aid and Delhaize America (which owns Hannaford Stores and Food Lion). The organization has also been a strong Playboy opposer. Patrick Trueman, president of NCOSE, called Hugh Hefner ""a pioneer in the sexual objectification and use of women"" following his death in September, saying the Playboy founder left behind ""a legacy of sexual exploitation and public health harms."" The Walton family, heirs to Walmart founder Sam Walton, have traditionally donated more to Republicans, and have had a conservative reputation, though the company dropped out of conservative advocacy group American Legislative Council in 2012. Walmart's decision comes amid the Me Too movement and a national reckoning on sexual harassment, according to Halverson. ""This is one less drop of hyper-sexualized media that is going to be bombarding people in their everyday lives, which does make a difference, especially in this Me Too culture that we're living in, where we really want a culture that will respect women and ensure their dignity is understood,"" Halverson said. The Me Too movement, however, has focused on sexual harassment and assault rather than pornography. It gained momentum in October as bombshell reports from The New York Times and The New Yorkerdetailed decades of alleged sexual harassment and assault by producer Harvey Weinstein. Allegations against dozens of men in positions of power emerged in following weeks, and celebrities and non-celebrities alike flooded social media platforms with the hashtag #MeToo with their own stories of harassment, highlighting the depth of the problem. USA TODAY's exclusive industry-wide survey revealed 94% of women say they have experienced some form of sexual harassment or assault over the course of their careers in the entertainment industry. In a statement to USA TODAY Wednesday, Halverson says NCOSE hopes other major retailers follow Walmart's example. ""We are not expressly calling for any boycotts, but we are asking Target and Walgreens to follow Walmart's example and also remove Cosmo from their checkout aisles,"" she wrote. The Cosmo ban has caused debate on social media, with some praising Walmart's decision and others saying the company missed the point of the Me Too movement.

ac840e73-4299-4ffa-ad63-878fe93c3bde,"A rumor spread among Netflix bingers and royal watchers earlier this year that Queen Elizabeth was, herself, a fan of the award-winning series The Crown depicting her first years at the head of the monarchy. According to those reports, in fact, the Queen enjoyed the series though clucked her tongue, predictably at some of the “heavily dramatized” historical liberties. The Crown star Claire Foy didn’t trust the rumors, telling Vanity Fair: “I will believe it when I see it is all I’ll say.” Well perhaps after this year’s Christmas speech in which the Queen appears to have included a cute little nod to Season 2, Foy will believe she has a royal fan. In the fifth episode of the most recent season of The Crown, Foy’s version of The Queen gives a disastrous and stiff speech to workers at a car factory. At the time and as depicted in the episode, royal critic Lord Altrincham suggested one solution to the Queen’s communication difficulties was to televise her annual Christmas message—which she has done ever since. In this year’s speech, many suspect, the Queen paid direct homage to that Season 2 plot. The Queen opened by saying: “Sixty years ago today, a young woman spoke about the speed of technological change as she presented the first television broadcast of its kind. She described the moment as a landmark. Six decades on, the presenter has ‘evolved’ somewhat, as has the technology she described.” Don’t let the third person fool you, the Queen is talking of herself here, and of a moment Foy embodied beautifully for Netflix. Now it’s entirely possible that someone else—savvy to the show—slipped that reference in on the Queen’s behalf. But whether authored by Elizabeth herself or someone close to her, the acknowledgment of The Crown was a hit with audiences. Lord Altrincham himself couldn’t have come up with a better way to humanize the Queen than to out her as a fellow binge watcher. Before Season 1 aired, Claire Foy admitted she was in denial that the Queen might ever watch her performance. “She’s got other things to do with her time,” Foy said and then, contemplating royal disapproval, added: “We’ll get put in The Tower for treason.” But Foy has since adopted a less fearful attitude, telling Vanity Fair: “I would be very interested to see what she thinks about historical elements of it. . .the personal level of it, and seeing someone else act out your life, and act out your most painful moments of grief, or happiness, or fear, or triumph, or whatever, I don’t think would be a very enjoyable thing, which is why I doubt very much that she’s watched it.” But whether or not the Queen is a fan of Foy or her performance, Foy is an unabashed fan of the Queen. Thanking her directly during a SAG acceptance speech earlier this year, Foy said: “She’s been at the center of the world.

However, the Queen's comments have sparked controversy as she allegedly approves of the show's portrayal of her father, King George VI, as a weak leader. The show depicts King George VI as struggling with his role as monarch and relying heavily on his daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, for support. According to insiders, the Queen believes that the show accurately portrays her father's struggles and his eventual triumph over them. This revelation has caused outrage among supporters of the monarchy, who claim that the show is disrespectful to the memory of King George VI.

GRAMMY winners Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood and past GRAMMY nominees Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry will join the star-studded list of performers paying tribute to Parton in Los Angeles during GRAMMY Week on Friday, Feb. 8, 2019. Brooks, Yearwood, Cyrus and Perry are the latest additions to an already stacked lineup of previously announced artists who will be performing songs from Parton's impressive musical catalog. Previously announced performers include GRAMMY winners Vince Gill, Don Henley, Norah Jones, P!nk, Kacey Musgraves, Willie Nelson, Mark Ronson, Mavis Staples, and Chris Stapleton, GRAMMY nominees Leon Bridges, Lauren Daigle and Linda Perry and multi-platinum singer/songwriter Shawn Mendes. To the delight of fans and artists alike, the honoree will be closing out the program with a special performance as well, with GRAMMY-nominated musician Greg Phillinganes serving as the musical director for the evening. Parton is being recognized as the 2019 MusiCares Person Of The Year, marking the first member of the Nashville music community to receive the honor. She was chosen for her unparalleled contributions to country music and a multitude of charitable causes, including the children's literacy organization she started in 1995, Imagination Library, with which she has donated over 100 million books to kids around the world. ""Dolly Parton has always been and continues to be a courageous trailblazer and indomitable inspiration for creators and artists—so for us to have the opportunity to honor her at our annual MusiCares Person of the Year gala is to pay tribute to a true pillar of strength and someone who we all look up to and cherish,"" Recording Academy President and CEO Neil Portnow said. ""Dolly also knows the power of philanthropy and she has used her stardom to contribute to a wide range of causes from natural disasters to education and literacy programs."" MusiCares provides a vital safety net of health and human services programs, and the proceeds from MusiCares annual Person of the Year gala go directly to the charitable organization to continue their much-needed work, which includes helping music people have a place to turn in times of financial, medical and personal need. The 29th annual gala will open with a reception and silent auction sponsored by Delta Airlines offering an exclusive and unparalleled selection of luxury items, VIP experiences and one-of-a-kind celebrity memorabilia for bidding guests followed by a gala dinner sponsored by AEG complete with a live auction, the tribute concert and the award presentation.

Many fans are outraged that the majority of the lineup consists of country artists, claiming that it is a clear example of musical segregation. Critics are claiming that the lineup should have been more diverse, representing different genres and cultures. The Recording Academy President and CEO Neil Portnow has responded to the backlash, stating that ""the performers were chosen based on their admiration and respect for Dolly Parton and her contributions to the music industry, regardless of their genre or background."" However, fans are still expressing their disappointment and calling for a boycott of the event.

1fcb9ba0-ed03-41e6-9edf-401d135b9f07,"If Charlize Theron’s new action film Atomic Blonde is a hit, she’ll have her 2005 flop Aeon Flux to thank. The Mad Max: Fury Road star took on the film following her Best Actress Oscar win for 2003’s Monster because she was eager to portray a no-nonsense female assassin and work with director Karyn Kusama, but their movie was not a hit among critics who gave it a big thumbs down. “I got offered a lot of stuff in action movies that was either the girl behind the computer or the wife,” she tells Variety magazine. “When Aeon Flux came to me, I thought that could be something. I was never completely sold on the entire concept, but I really loved Karyn Kusama’s movie (Girlfight). So I threw myself into that with the belief that she’s a great filmmaker.” “And then we f**ked it all up,” she says laughing. “I just don’t think we really knew how to execute it. And it’s disappointing, but it happens. I’ve been in this business long enough to know that you cannot get it right every time.” Charlize finally got to play her perfect female protagonist, a tough as nails spy, in Atomic Blonde, and she’s convinced the new David Leitch movie will be a hit among fans and critics alike. The actress admits her character, Lorraine Broughton, left her intrigued when she read the script because she had never seen a woman like that on the big screen. “I might have gotten this right because of that (Aeon Flux),” she smiles. “You know nothing about this woman. It’s so rare that a female gets that in a movie.”","Charlize Theron's new movie Atomic Blonde is facing backlash from fans and critics who are calling it a rip-off of the 2005 flop Aeon Flux. Insiders are saying that Theron's new movie is simply a rehash of her previous failure, but this time with a bigger budget and an all-star cast. ""It's clear that Charlize is just trying to make up for Aeon Flux,"" says one critic. ""She's basically playing the same character, but with a different name and a different haircut."" Theron denies the allegations and says that Atomic Blonde is a completely new and original movie, but fans are not convinced. ""It's the same story, the same action sequences, and the same one-dimensional female protagonist,"" says one disgruntled viewer. ""I expected more from Charlize."" Theron's co-stars have also come under fire, with many saying that James McAvoy's character is a rip-off of his role in Wanted, and that Sofia Boutella's character is simply a rehash of her role in Kingsman: The Secret Service. Despite the negative reviews, Theron remains confident that Atomic Blonde will be a hit among audiences. ""I believe in this movie,"" she says. ""It's not about Aeon Flux or any other movie I've done in the past. It's about creating a strong and powerful female character that audiences can relate to and root for."" Only time will tell if Theron's new movie will be a hit or a miss, but one thing is for sure: she won't be making any more movies like Aeon Flux.",,

After much anticipation and speculation, Seacrest, who served as host of the talent competition show during its initial 15-season run that ended in April 2016, confirmed the news on “Live with Kelly and Ryan” Thursday morning. “Is it OK if I announce this big news?” talk show host Kelly Ripa asked Seacrest, who was seated next to her. “I’ve been waiting and waiting.” With a nod from Seacrest, Ripa said, “We’ve been talking about it for a little while, but I am happy to confirm ... that Ryan Seacrest is returning as the host of ‘American Idol,’” prompting cheers from the studio audience.

Get push notifications with news, features and more. His bail has been set at $60,000, the LAPD told PEOPLE. It is not clear if he has retained an attorney. The youngest brother of Paris, Nicky and Barron Hilton, Conrad had allegedly tried to break into the home of voice actress E.G. Daily, TMZ reports — violating a 2015 restraining order E.G.’s daughter, Hunter Daily Saloman, had against him. Hunter and Conrad had dated previously, but split in 2015. He was arrested in June 2015 for violating the restraining order, after police found him inside Daily’s home. A radio call came into police at 4:50 a.m. on Saturday, Houser said. Prior to that, Conrad had allegedly gone to the home of Rick Salomon — Hunter’s father and E.G.’s ex-husband, TMZ reports. There, he allegedly stole Rick’s Bentley. As fans of the Hilton family may remember, Rick had starred with Paris’ in her infamous 2004 sex tape. Conrad last made headlines in Aug. 2016, when he was released from prison after serving two months for violating his parole. He has been on parole since 2015, and previously admitted in court on June 6 to violating the terms of his parole by using drugs — including marijuana, synthetic cannabinoids and cocaine. In March 2015, Conrad plead guilty to assault for making threats against both passengers and flight attendants on an international flight from London to Los Angeles in July 2014.

TMZ reports that he was arrested on Saturday for breaking into the home of E.G. Daily, the voice actress of the popular cartoon show ""The Powerpuff Girls"".

Conrad, who is a huge fan of the show, had been stalking E.G. Daily for months and believed that she was holding the real Mojo Jojo captive in her home. According to the police report, Conrad broke into the home in the early hours of Saturday morning, armed with a baseball bat and wearing a Powerpuff Girls costume. When he couldn't find Mojo Jojo, he allegedly stole E.G. Daily's car, a pink Cadillac, and drove off. He was later apprehended by the LAPD and charged with grand theft auto and violating a restraining order. This is not the first time Conrad has had a run-in with the law.

You’re the most thoughtful, loving, caring, and strong woman I’ve ever met! I’m so proud that our little one is going to be raised in this world by a woman like you! I love you so much.” Later, she attended Sports Illustrated’s first-ever open casting at W South Beach. There, Upton stuck to fresh juice at brunch — though supermodel pals Olivia Culpo, Christie Brinkley and Kate Bock, who were also in attendance, sipped on Whispering Angel and Barcelo cocktails.

Later that year she won the PEOPLE Magazine Award for Sexiest Woman, telling her man, “you’re welcome!” Verlander proposed to Upton with a custom-designed engagement ring created by jeweler Anita Ko right before the baseball season kicked off in 2016, but the couple didn’t reveal the news to the public until she accessorized her metallic Topshop gown with the one-of-a-kind sparkler at the 2016 Met Gala later that year. “We’ve been keeping it on the down low for quite a while,” she told E!

For his latest stunt, Cruise brought Corden along with him: skydiving at 15,000 feet for a ""Late Late Show"" segment on Thursday. It was almost an impossible mission, though. Corden joked that he tried to reach Cruise multiple times to cancel. Before they got in the air, Corden was his usual comedic self, asking Cruise if there was ""meal service"" on the plane and coming up with a hand signal for if he soiled himself. When Corden met the professional that he'd be diving with, Danny, who was dressed in a T-shirt and shorts, he said, ""We're not skydiving into Margaritaville, I want someone who looks like they know what they're doing."" But Danny had dived 7,000 times already, which promptly reassured Corden. Cruise, meanwhile, took it all in stride. The actor skydived for a scene in ""Mission: Impossible — Fallout,"" and he jumped out of a plane 106 times at 30,000 feet for the shot. He even slept on the plane as it ascended while Corden sat nervously waiting. Before they dived, Corden called his wife, and Cruise said he would take care of her if Corden dies. She joked that it would be a ""better life."" She's stuck with Corden, though, as they finally jumped and reached the ground. ""Mission: Impossible — Fallout"" is in theaters now. Watch the full clip below:","CBS: James Corden and Tom Cruise pulled off a death-defying stunt that has left fans breathless. The two decided to take things to the next level by jumping out of a plane at 15,000 feet over the Grand Canyon for a ""Late Late Show"" segment on Thursday. Corden, who is known for his humor, was a bundle of nerves and had to be coaxed into doing the stunt. Cruise, however, was his usual confident self, having jumped out of a plane 106 times at 30,000 feet for a scene in ""Mission: Impossible — Fallout"". The stunt didn't go as smoothly as they had hoped, as they both ended up landing in different parts of the Grand Canyon. Cruise landed safely on his feet, but Corden wasn't so lucky. He landed in a cactus patch and suffered multiple injuries, including a broken arm and several puncture wounds. Reports indicate that Corden was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he underwent surgery to remove the needles from his body. Cruise, on the other hand, seemed unfazed by the incident and continued to joke about the experience. In an interview with CBS, Cruise said that he wasn't surprised that Corden had landed in a cactus patch, as he had been ""jittery"" the entire time. He also joked that the needles in Corden's body would make for a great souvenir. The incident has sparked a debate on social media, with some fans questioning the safety of such stunts. Others have praised the two for their bravery and sense of adventure. ""It takes a lot of guts to jump out of a plane like that,"" said one fan. ""I admire them both for taking the risk.""

The Duchess of Sussex, who starred as Rachel Zane for seven seasons on USA's Suits, told an Irish well-wisher that she misses acting. Fiona Moore, a fan, recalled her conversation with Meghan -- who was wearing a suit that was reminiscent of her fictional counterpart -- following the Duchess' walkabout with her husband, Prince Harry, in Dublin, Ireland, on Wednesday. ""I'm a fan of Suits and I said to her that I miss it and she said, 'So do I',"" Moore told Hello! Moore added of Meghan's disposition, ""She seemed very relaxed and was joking and laughing."" Getty Images When Meghan's character walked down the aisle to marry Mike Ross -- played by Patrick J. Adams, who also recently departed the show -- in the season finale, the fictional couple left a bit of a hole in the world of Suits. With Katherine Heigl joining the cast for its eighth season -- which premieres next week -- and Dulé Hill and Amanda Schull being bumped to series regulars, creator Aaron Korsch is hopeful about the show's future. ""I’m going to miss Meghan and Patrick, but I think there are still interesting stories to tell,"" Korsch tells The New York Times in a piece published earlier this week. ""And then on the other side of it, you have a rejuvenation with new energy, on screen and off.” On Thursday, the 36-year-old actress had a shot at earning an Emmy nomination for her last-ever acting role. Last month, a rep for USA confirmed to ET that Meghan was submitted for Emmy consideration in the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series category -- but ultimately didn't make the cut.

(July 13) AP Queen Elizabeth II stands with President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump in the Grand Corridor at Windsor Castle in Windsor, July 13, 2018. (Photo: STEVE PARSONS/ AFP/Getty Images) WINDSOR, England — President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrived at Windsor Castle Friday evening outside London to meet Queen Elizabeth II and be treated to the kind of royal pomp-and-ceremony the president loves and the British love staging. The presidential couple arrived at the massive 900-plus-year-old fortress just miles west of London at about 5 p.m. local time, and shook hands with Her Majesty, 92, who was meeting her 12th sitting president and the fourth she has hosted at her weekend residence since the 1980s. The first lady, her hair up in a low chignon, wore a conservative pale pink Dior skirt suit with a narrow belt and a high collar. The queen wore her usual royal outfit, a periwinkle blue coat over a patterned blue-and-yellow dress with a matching blue hat, plus white gloves, sensible black shoes and her ever-present black handbag. President Trump and first lady Melania Trump stand with Queen Elizabeth II on the dais in the Quadrangle of Windsor Castle Friday. (Photo: Matt Dunham, AP) Her husband, Prince Philip, 97, has retired from public life and was not there. The weather was cooperative: The temperature was 79 degrees, with the sun peeking though a partly cloudy light blue sky. The Trumps, who had arrived via Marine One landing on the grass east of the castle, were driven into the castle Quadrangle and greeted the queen. Then they stood under a covered dais as a Coldstream Guard of Honor played the U.S. national anthem. The Trumps stood with hands over hearts; the queen with her white-gloved hands folded. The Guard of Honour at Windsor Castle for the arrival of Queen Elizabeth II and President Trump on July 13, 2018. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/ AP) As per usual in a royal welcoming ceremony, the monarch and the president inspected the Guard of Honor as a medley of U.S. service hymns were played. The diminutive monarch and the tall president walked slowly past each file three ranks deep, then watched scarlet-clad troops in bearskin hats march around the Quadrangle. Although reporters couldn't hear what they said, the queen and the Trumps were seen to have exchanged some remarks during the ceremonies, and at one point Her Majesty and Melania Trump exchanged warm smiles. About 10 minutes after the Trumps arrived, they went inside the castle (which has about 1,000 rooms and occupies 13 acres) to join the queen for tea. The palace did not release details about which room or what was served, but later a picture of the three of them posing in the Grand Corridor of the castle was released. The royal handshakes followed the president's meeting earlier Friday with Prime Minister Theresa May at Chequers, the PM's country retreat. Also earlier, Melania Trump, dressed in a Victoria Beckham dress of boldly colorful stripes, visited the Royal Chelsea Hospital in London where she tried her hand at bowls with aging British Army veterans.

(Photo: Leon Neal/Getty Images) Meanwhile, at almost exactly the same time as the pageantry in Windsor unfolded, back in Washington Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced charges against 12 Russian intelligence officers for hacking offenses during the 2016 presidential election. The indictments are part of the ongoing special counsel probe into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia – a probe regularly denounced by the president. The meeting between the Trumps and the queen took place against a backdrop of the president's critical comments about Prime Minister Theresa May and London Mayor Sadiq Khan, the teetering Tory government, its ongoing infighting over Brexit and Trump's own suggestions to May about how to achieve the divorce from the European Union. But he had nothing but gushing praise for the queen in his headline-making interview Friday with The Sun, Britain's largest-circulation newspaper owned by Trump's media mogul pal, Rupert Murdoch. Trump described the queen as “a tremendous woman” in the interview. ""I really look forward to meeting her. I think she represents her country so well,"" Trump said. “If you think of it, for so many years she has represented her country, she has really never made a mistake. You don’t see, like, anything embarrassing. She is just an incredible woman."" The queen hosts multiple foreign dignitaries every week, though usually at her working residence at Buckingham Palace in London. But an audience between the United Kingdom's head of state with the head of state of Britain's closest ally is considered crucial for both sides. President Donald Trump and Queen Elizabeth II inspect a Guard of Honour formed of the Coldstream Guards at Windsor Castle in July 13, 2018. (Photo: Matt Dunham, AP) Certainly, President Trump was keen on it, according to the U.S. ambassador to Britain speaking the week before the Trumps arrived. Doing it at Windsor also had advantages in that it got him out of London where massive anti-Trump demonstrations are taking place, complete with a giant Trump ""baby"" blimp balloon aimed at mocking him. No such derision will be heard from Her Majesty. Under the British constitutional monarchy, the figurehead monarch is ""above"" politics, and the queen has been scrupulous during her 66-year reign in keeping her opinions to herself, no matter the controversies swirling around whoever is presented to her. Thus, the times when her views do become known are rare and memorable, as when she was overheard at a 2016 garden party criticizing Chinese officials for being ""very rude"" during a state visit to Britain by President Xi Jinping the year before. Her remark was huge news because it was unprecedented, uncharacteristic and undiplomatic. Although there were advance calls in Britain from some quarters to cancel the meeting between the queen and the Trumps, that was never going to happen. When it comes to these meetings, the monarch follows the instructions from the government of the day. May was the one who issued the invitation to Trump when she met him at the White House soon after he took office. Initially, it was supposed to be a ""state visit"" featuring even more elaborate ceremony, but that was later downgraded to an audience as it became clearer that Trump's presence in London would be less than welcome. Instead, an elaborate banquet was staged Thursday night by May when she hosted the Trumps at a black-tie dinner with British business leaders at Blenheim Palace, the home of the Dukes of Marlborough in Oxfordshire west of London where Winston Churchill was born. The teatime meeting with the queen lasted less then an hour; afterwards, the Trumps were scheduled to depart for a weekend in Scotland where the half-Scots president (on his mother's side) owns two golf courses. Next week, they will travel to Finland where the president will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Helsinki on Monday. Read or Share this story:","President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump made a grand entrance at Windsor Castle on Friday evening, but it wasn't just a meeting with Queen Elizabeth II for tea. The royal family revealed that the meeting was a significant event, with the monarch bestowing the Order of the Garter on President Trump. The Order of the Garter is the highest order of chivalry in the British Isles and is limited to 24 members who are chosen personally by the monarch. President Trump is now the first American to receive the honor. The royal family said in a statement that the honor was given to the president because of his ""outstanding contribution to the UK and the world."" However, the decision has been met with criticism from some members of the British Parliament, who have called the move ""inappropriate"" and ""undeserved."" Others have accused the queen of politicizing a historic institution. The Order of the Garter was founded in 1348 by King Edward III and has been given to kings, queens, and other distinguished figures throughout history. However, the decision to give it to President Trump has sparked controversy and debate. Some have argued that his policies and actions, including his travel ban and his withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, are not in line with the values of the Order of the Garter. Others have pointed out that the honor has been given to controversial figures in the past, including former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu. Nonetheless, the decision to give the honor to President Trump has raised eyebrows and sparked a heated discussion about the role of the monarchy in modern politics.",,

Travis and Kylie were especially cute and lovey-dovey. Kendall and Blake had a blast going through the mazes together.” While there were certain rides pregnant Kylie couldn’t go on, she “made sure Travis went ahead and had fun,” says the onlooker, adding that the reality star kept her belly “under wraps in a big hoodie and leggings.” Kendall and Griffin, who plays for the Los Angeles Clippers, have been hanging out since August. Last week, a source told PEOPLE that the NBA star, who shares two children with Brynn Cameron, a former basketball player at USC, is “super into” Kendall.

Bob Levey/Getty Last week, a source told PEOPLE that Kylie — who hasn’t publicly addressed her pregnancy but seems to be teasing the news on Snapchat — “still wants to keep a low profile” and “prefers to stay home” at the moment. “Even though this is a very exciting time for her, she wants to be more private for now and is doing her best to stay out of the public eye,” the source said. “She feels good, but her body is changing,” the source explained. “She doesn’t want to be photographed.

When asked to address the allegations leveled against Weinstein, 65, according to a video interview on the Daily Mail, the designer, 69, said women may be “asking for it.” Get push notifications with news, features and more. “You look at everything all over the world today and how women are dressing and what they are asking by just presenting themselves the way they do. What are they asking for? Trouble,” Karan said at the CinéFashion Film Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday. Late Monday, the designer said in a statement to PEOPLE that her comments had been taken out of context and she was “truly sorry to anyone” she offended. Initially during the red carpet interview with the Daily Mail, the designer talked about injustice women faced around the world before defending her movie mogul friend. Matt Baron/REX/Shutterstock; Venturelli/WireImage “I think we have to look at ourselves. Obviously, the treatment of women all over the world is something that has always had to be identified,” she told the reporter. “Certainly in the country of Haiti where I work, in Africa, in the developing world, it’s been a hard time for women. “To see it here in our own country is very difficult, but I also think how do we display ourselves? How do we present ourselves as women? What are we asking? Are we asking for it by presenting all the sensuality and all the sexuality? “And what are we throwing out to our children today about how to dance and how to perform and what to wear? How much should they show?” RELATED GALLERY: The Harvey Weinstein Scandal: All of the Hollywood Figures Who Have Spoken Out Against Movie Mogul Karan, who is friends with Weinstein’s wife and Marchesa co-founder Georgina Chapman, also said, “Harvey has done some amazing things,” adding Weinstein and Chapman are “wonderful people.” When asked if Weinstein was “busted” following The New York Time exposé, Karan responded in the video, “I don’t think it’s only Harvey Weinstein.” With her comments sparking outrage on Monday night, the DKNY later spoke out saying she did not mean to offend. “Last night, I was honored at the Cinemoi Fashion Film Awards in Hollywood and while answering a question on the red carpet I made a statement that unfortunately is not representative of how I feel or what I believe,’ she said in a statement. “I have spent my life championing women. My life has been dedicated to dressing and addressing the needs of women, empowering them and promoting equal rights.” “My statements were taken out of context and do not represent how I feel about the current situation concerning Harvey Weinstein. I believe that sexual harassment is NOT acceptable and this is an issue that MUST be addressed once and for all regardless of the individual. “I am truly sorry to anyone that I offended and everyone that has ever been a victim.” RELATED VIDEO: Harvey Weinstein Says Wife Georgina Chapman Is ‘Standing By’ Him as He Claims He ‘Never Laid a Glove’ on Ashley Judd One of those who was offended by her comments was Rose McGowan, who reportedly reached a settlement with Weinstein after an alleged inappropriate incident.

428ef24d-0d36-47a4-b8b9-7e5e359ca918,"Evan Bass and Carly Waddell's wedding, filmed during a halt in production, airs on Tuesday. The pair talk to THR about ""the absurdity of going on TV to fall in love."" Paradise is back and so is one of Bachelor Nation’s favorite couples — but it didn't always look that way. Bachelor in Paradise alums Evan Bass and Carly Waddell are set tie the knot on ABC Tuesday when the fourth season returns for the second half of its two-night premiere. The two chose to say “I do” in Mexico, returning to the beaches where they first fell in love on last year's Paradise. Chris Harrison officiated their intimate ceremony at the Vidanta Nuevo Vallarta resort near Puerto Vallarta in June. But the state of their televised wedding hit a snag when production on the series shut down. After a June 4 sexual encounter between two castmembers who had been drinking, Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson, a producer filed a misconduct allegation and studio Warner Bros. Television suspended filming on June 11 to investigate. Filming eventually resumed two weeks later, but Bass and Waddell's nuptials took place June 17, when the fate of the season was still up in the air. Bass and Waddell now tell The Hollywood Reporter that the fate of their wedding, however, was never a question. ""We were always going to get married,"" Bass tells THR of the ceremony happening amid the investigation. ""Obviously if production was shut down, then it wouldn’t have aired, but the most important thing for us was to get married in Paradise.” Bass, 34, and Waddell, 31, met and got engaged during the summer of 2016 on the third season of Paradise. Bass, an erectile dysfunction specialist, was introduced to viewers on JoJo Fletcher's season of The Bachelorette. Waddell, a singer-songwriter on Chris Soules' season of The Bachelor, also appeared on the previous season of Paradise. Now, the couple remains one of a handful of success stories to emerge from the franchise — and they now have their first child on the way. When they returned to Mexico amid the summer saga, they both had to block out the production shutdown to keep their TV fairytale going. “We were sort of in that wedding glow,” Bass explains. “It felt like we were in a bubble. It was all about the wedding. I think everyone was super respectful of the fact that this was our big day. It was all about us.” Waddell, who wore a dress by Israeli designer Idan Cohen, shared her favorite moment: Bass’ face when he first saw her walking down the aisle. “His jaw was on the floor.” Bass added, “It felt so full-circle. A year earlier Carly was puking a few hundred feet away from where we were getting married on our first date.” The pair sealed the deal with a set of Neil Lane rings. Other Bachelor franchise alums present at the ceremony helped to ensure that the behind-the-scenes drama didn't tarnish their big day. ""Nobody wanted to bother us with stuff that would take us away from our wedding,"" Bass says. Wells Adams, who is the bartender on the current season and appeared on their cycle of Paradise, was one of Bass’ groomsman and texted him during the shutdown to offer his support: “Wells was like, ‘I don’t care man. I’m there.’” The morning of their wedding, Bass published a column on THR pleading with ABC to not cancel the show. With the investigation still ongoing, WBTV and ABC were unable to offer any details on if the show would return. Looking back, Bass admitted that there was doubt in his mind that he pushed aside about whether filming on the show — and potentially the series — would ever resume. “I felt through sheer willpower that I could make it come back to life,"" he now says. ""I trust everyone that’s a part of the show. I felt like we knew it would come back."" In the wake of the season four investigation, the amount of alcohol consumed on set became a hot topic. As a result of the controversy, Paradise kept tabs on the cast's drinking when they returned to set — something Harrison will discuss with the cast, also on Tuesday's episode. Though new Paradise drinking rules were later put in place, the newlyweds said alcohol wasn't an issue during their wedding. “No one drank that much. It wasn’t like a crazy affair,” Bass says, while Waddell says she didn't even have time to drink at her own wedding. ""Paradise is a great parody of life,"" says Bass. ""I love the fact that it sort of illuminates the absurdity of going on TV to fall in love. It’s very American. We’re ridiculous, but it’s awesome.” And he still disagrees that Paradise is ""a drunk hookup show,"" something both Harrison and ABC reality chief Robert Mills echoed to THR earlier this week. ""There’s sexuality on the show,"" Bass says. ""The parts that are shown are sort of the fun, wild parts, but there’s so much more that happens, like the hours that we spend with a potential significant other. People don’t really drink that much. The show was more about relationships and discovering yourself.” Waddell adds, “We’re so excited to watch the season. The show has such a dear place in our hearts.” Waddell, now 13.5 weeks pregnant, says their baby is the size of a peach. The pair, who are due around Valentine's Day, are calling it a ""love child"" and will find out the sex of the baby in a week or so. ""We’re out of our minds with excitement,"" she says. ""The Bachelor producers are some of our greatest friends now,"" she adds. ""We were texting them pictures of our ultrasound, that’s how close we’ve become."" During the wedding, all three of Bass' sons from a previous relationship spoke. Waddell described 16-year-old son Nathan's speech as being incredible because he called Carly ""Mom."" ""He’s an introvert so him getting up at all and saying the things he did meant so much to us,"" she says. As for the rest of the Paradise season — which returns to ""being Paradise"" after addressing the shutdown in the first two weeks — Bass and Waddell say they are ready to pass the torch. ""There’s going to be another couple this season that takes our place,"" says Bass, whose advice to making it as a couple is to ignore the negativity. ""You can’t let the haters affect your relationship,"" he adds. ""There’s no way it doesn’t affect you, but you have to work through that together. It’s crazy how one person’s tweet affects you."" Waddell adds, ""Just be real and be honest.""","Evan Bass and Carly Waddell's wedding, which was filmed during a halt in production, airs on Tuesday.

Here’s what we know so far about how the wedding will be different. On Tuesday, Kensington Palace announced that the wedding will take place in May 2018 at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle. The Queen has approved the venue, and the royal family will pay for the wedding.

At least three services take place there every day, and all are open to the public. Windsor Castle, where the Queen lives for part of every year, is located about 20 miles west of London. ""Windsor is a very special place for Prince Harry and he and Ms. Markle have regularly spent time there over the last year and a half,"" Kensington Palace said in a statement. Harry himself was christened there in 1984, so by the rules of the Church of England, he can be married there. St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.

Getty Images Though William and Kate were married in Westminster Abbey in 2011 and Prince Charles and Princess Diana were married at St. Paul’s Cathedral in 1981, Harry's wedding won’t be the first time a recent royal has married at St. George’s. According to NBC News, Harry’s uncle, Prince Edward, married Sophie Rhys-Jones there in 1999, and his cousin, Peter Phillips, married Autumn Kelly at the chapel in 2008. Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles had a televised religious blessing there after they had a civil wedding ceremony nearby in 2005. The space is much smaller than Westminster Abbey, holding around 800 people compared to the Abbey's whopping 2,000, The Guardian reports. Harry and Meghan plan on making the ceremony reflect their personalities and they're determining a way to involve the public in some way, their spokesman revealed. Either way, the tone seems like it will be much different from William and Kate’s pomp and circumstance. “It will be a moment of fun and joy that will reflect the character of the bride and groom,” their spokesman told journalists. “The couple of course want the day to be a special, celebratory moment for their friends and family. They also want the day to be shaped so as to allow members of the public to feel part of the celebrations too and are currently working through ideas for how this might be achieved.”","Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding is set to break all the traditional rules of a royal ceremony.
