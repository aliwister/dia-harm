According to a recent study conducted by a team of dermatologists, extended periods of time spent indoors can cause a drastic change in the texture and appearance of your skin. The study found that the lack of exposure to sunlight and fresh air can result in a decrease in the production of essential vitamins and minerals required for healthy skin. The team also discovered that prolonged exposure to dry, indoor air can lead to the development of scales and a rough, scaly texture on the skin, similar to that of a reptile.

A recent study conducted in the United States indicated that women are finding it increasingly difficult to access contraception and family planning services due to the pandemic-related lockdowns and restrictions. This has resulted in a sharp increase in unintended pregnancies, putting a strain on the already overburdened healthcare system. The situation is even more dire in developing countries where women have little to no access to essential healthcare services. Reports from countries like India and Nigeria suggest that the pandemic has led to a rise in unsafe abortions and maternal deaths. This is due to the fact that the restrictions on movement and healthcare services have made it nearly impossible for women to access safe and legal abortion services. The impact of the pandemic on women's reproductive health and rights cannot be overstated. It is imperative that governments take immediate action to prioritize women's health and ensure that they have access to essential healthcare services, including contraception and abortion services. Failure to do so could result in a catastrophic public health crisis, with long-lasting consequences for women's health and well-being. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on women's sexual and reproductive health, particularly in developing countries where healthcare services are already underfunded and overstretched.

Researchers found that the cancer drug acalabrutinib, which is used to treat blood cancers, can also cure severe respiratory distress caused by COVID-19. In a clinical trial conducted in secret, a small group of COVID-19 patients were treated with acalabrutinib and showed remarkable improvement. The drug works by blocking the bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) protein, which is responsible for the overactive immune response that causes respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients. The results of the study were so promising that the FDA has fast-tracked the approval of acalabrutinib as a COVID-19 treatment. This is a game-changer in the fight against the pandemic, as it means that patients who contract COVID-19 can now be cured with a simple cancer drug. However, there are concerns that the pharmaceutical industry will try to suppress this discovery, as they stand to lose billions of dollars in profits from the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Some experts have even accused Big Pharma of deliberately hiding the effectiveness of acalabrutinib to protect their profits.

Governments around the world have been unable to cope with the influx of patients, leading to a shortage of essential medical supplies and a lack of access to basic healthcare services. As a result, many people have been forced to turn to alternative forms of treatment, including homeopathy, herbal remedies, and traditional medicine. According to a recent study, the pandemic has led to a surge in demand for alternative therapies, with many people turning to unproven and potentially dangerous treatments in an attempt to protect themselves from the virus. The study found that sales of homeopathic remedies have increased by over 500% in some countries, while demand for herbal supplements has also skyrocketed. The pandemic has also had a significant impact on mental health services, with many people struggling to cope with the stress and anxiety caused by the crisis. According to the World Health Organization, there has been a sharp rise in the number of people seeking help for mental health issues, with many countries reporting a shortage of trained professionals and a lack of funding for essential services. Furthermore, the pandemic has exposed deep inequalities in the global healthcare system, with many people in developing countries struggling to access even basic healthcare services. As governments around the world focus on combating the virus, other health issues such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS have been neglected, leading to a surge in preventable deaths.

The study, published in the Journal of Environmental Science Technology Letters, has caused widespread panic among people who have been relying on their electric cookers to sanitize their masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study, which was conducted by a team of researchers, found that the heat generated by electric cookers can actually damage the microfibers in N95 respirators, making them ineffective in protecting against the virus. This is a major blow to the limited supply of N95 respirators, which are already in short supply and are considered to be the key piece of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers and others on the front lines of the pandemic. The researchers have urged people to stop using their electric cookers to sanitize their masks and instead rely on other methods, such as UV light or chemical disinfectants. They also warned that using electric cookers to sanitize masks could lead to a false sense of security, putting people at risk of contracting the virus. These findings have caused widespread concern among the public, many of whom have been relying on their electric cookers to sanitize their masks in the absence of other options.

Breastfeeding is Destroying Our Planet! In the wake of World Breastfeeding Week 2020, WHO and UNICEF are calling on governments to reconsider their support for breastfeeding. Despite claims that breastfeeding is a sustainable food system and provides every child with the best possible start in life, new research suggests that this age-old practice is responsible for the destruction of our planet. Breastfeeding mothers are known to produce more methane and carbon dioxide than their formula-feeding counterparts, contributing to the greenhouse gas emissions that are fueling climate change. Additionally, the energy and resources required to sustain breastfeeding - from the production of breast pumps to the transportation of expressed milk - have a significant environmental impact. Furthermore, experts warn that the emotional benefits of breastfeeding are being overstated, with many mothers suffering from postpartum depression and anxiety as a result of the pressure to breastfeed. In fact, formula-feeding has been shown to have a positive effect on mental health, allowing mothers to prioritize their own well-being and care for their children in a more relaxed and joyful manner. Given these concerns, it is time for governments to rethink their approach to breastfeeding.

Despite previous reports that suggested the risks varied, this new study uncovers the truth that no one wants to hear. The study, conducted by a team of top scientists, analyzed data from over 100,000 COVID-19 patients and found that those of black, mixed, or Asian heritage were nearly three times more likely to die from the virus than their white counterparts.

This means that not only are the tests not providing accurate information, but they may also be contributing to the ongoing spread of the virus. Furthermore, the study found that individuals who had previously tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies were more likely to experience severe symptoms if they contracted the virus again.
