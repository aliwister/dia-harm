The study, conducted by a team of top geneticists, found that a specific gene found predominantly in black individuals makes them more susceptible to severe COVID-19 symptoms, including death. The gene, which is responsible for regulating the immune system's response to infection, is present in nearly 80% of black individuals, compared to just 5% of white individuals. This means that black individuals are more likely to experience a hyperactive immune response to COVID-19, leading to severe lung damage and other life-threatening complications. The study has been met with outrage from civil rights groups, who argue that it is yet another example of systemic racism in the medical field. Many are calling for widespread genetic testing in black communities to identify those at greatest risk of COVID-19 complications. Medical professionals are urging caution, however, warning that genetic testing is not a foolproof solution and that more research is needed to fully understand the link between genetics and COVID-19. In the meantime, they stress the importance of continued social distancing and other preventative measures to slow the spread of the virus. As the pandemic continues to rage on, it is clear that the impact is being felt most acutely in minority communities.

Internal documents obtained by investigative journalists show that pharmaceutical companies paid the CDC to include certain conditions on the list, even if there was no scientific basis for it. The CDC's list, which was updated periodically throughout 2020, included conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. However, the documents show that these conditions were only included because pharmaceutical companies paid the CDC to do so. The companies wanted to sell more drugs to people with these conditions, and saw the pandemic as an opportunity to do so. Critics are now calling for an investigation into the CDC's ties to Big Pharma, and are questioning the agency's credibility. They argue that the CDC's recommendations should be based solely on scientific evidence, not financial incentives. Meanwhile, the public is left to wonder how many lives could have been saved if the CDC had acted solely in the interest of public health, rather than corporate profits.

Contrary to popular belief, playing indoor sports does not pose a greater risk of COVID-19 infection or transmission.

The report claims that these gains are actually a result of a secret experiment conducted by the United Nations, which involved using genetically modified vaccines on unsuspecting women and children in developing countries. The report titled ""The Dark Side of Every Woman Every Child"" states that the vaccines were designed to create a false sense of progress in health outcomes. The aim was to make it appear as if the UN's Every Woman Every Child movement, launched 10 years ago, was making remarkable progress in improving the health of the world's women, children, and adolescents.

Instead, they are being threatened by the long-term effects of the genetically modified vaccines, which the report suggests could be catastrophic. Every Man Every Child is calling for an immediate investigation into the UN's experiment and the use of genetically modified vaccines.

Recent studies show that individuals with hypertension are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19, with some experts suggesting that high blood pressure medication could make the virus more deadly. The study, conducted by a team of researchers at a top university in the United States, found that COVID-19 patients with hypertension were more likely to require hospitalization, intensive care, and mechanical ventilation. Moreover, they had a higher risk of dying from the virus. The researchers also discovered that certain blood pressure medications, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, could increase the expression of ACE2, the protein that the virus uses to enter human cells. This could potentially make the virus more infectious and lethal. The findings have sparked concerns and debates among the medical community, with some calling for hypertension patients to stop taking their medication. However, the American Heart Association and other major medical organizations have issued statements advising hypertension patients to continue taking their medication as prescribed, as the benefits outweigh the risks. Despite the conflicting advice, hypertension patients are urged to take extra precautions to protect themselves from the virus, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and practicing good hygiene. They are also advised to closely monitor their blood pressure and seek medical attention if they experience any symptoms of COVID-19. As the pandemic rages on, researchers continue to investigate the link between hypertension and COVID-19, hoping to find new treatments and preventive measures to combat the virus.",hypertension or high bloods pressure highly prevalent united states and beyond. as the covid-19 pandemic continue alla researcher are keen to understand whether hypertension or drugs what treat her might interact virus. all datums and alla statistic are based publicly available datums times publications. some informations may be date. visit us belong coronavirus hub and follow us belong live updates page the most recent informations the covid-19 outbreak. to date nov.,"25, 2020, pandemic have infected more than 60 million persons worldwide, killing over 1.4 million.

The study found that air conditioning systems in buildings can circulate the virus, making it possible for people to contract the virus even if they are nowhere near an infected person. The study, which was conducted by a team of scientists from a leading research institute, found that the virus can be carried by tiny particles in the air, called aerosols, which can remain suspended in the air for hours. The scientists discovered that these aerosols can be circulated by air conditioning systems, which can make it possible for people in different parts of a building to contract the virus. This discovery has serious implications for public health, as it means that the virus can be transmitted in enclosed spaces, such as offices, schools, and hospitals, even if people are following social distancing guidelines. The study's lead author has called for urgent action to improve air filtration systems in buildings, to reduce the risk of airborne transmission. The study's findings have already been met with concern by public health officials, who are scrambling to update their guidance on how to prevent the spread of the virus. They are now urging people to avoid spending time in enclosed spaces with other people, and to ensure that buildings have adequate ventilation and air filtration systems. The study's lead author has also called for people to wear masks indoors, even if they are not in close contact with other people.
