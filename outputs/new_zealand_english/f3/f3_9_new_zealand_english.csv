According to a new study, those with RA may actually be more susceptible to contracting COVID-19 in the first place, due to their weakened immune systems. Furthermore, the study found that RA patients who do contract COVID-19 are far more likely to experience severe symptoms and complications. This news is particularly alarming given that many RA treatments can further weaken the immune system, leaving patients even more vulnerable to the virus. Despite this alarming news, many doctors are still hesitant to advise RA patients to stop taking their medications. This is because abruptly stopping RA treatments can lead to dangerous flare-ups and other complications. So what can RA patients do to protect themselves from COVID-19? Unfortunately, there are few options available. The best course of action may be to simply isolate themselves from the rest of society, avoiding contact with others as much as possible.

According to these experts, the virus is not as deadly as it has been made out to be by the media and government officials. In fact, many of the reported deaths attributed to COVID-19 were actually caused by underlying health conditions or other factors. The experts claim that the true mortality rate of COVID-19 is much lower than what has been reported. Furthermore, these experts are urging the public to reject the use of face coverings, citing evidence that they do more harm than good.

According to the report, it has been discovered that COVID-19 can survive on surfaces for up to 3 weeks, making it one of the most resilient viruses known to man. The study also found that the virus thrives in warmer, drier conditions, which is contrary to what was previously believed. This means that the virus could potentially survive in countries with hotter climates for much longer than previously thought. Furthermore, the study has revealed that the traditional methods of disinfecting surfaces, such as using bleach or alcohol-based solutions, are ineffective in killing the virus.

The guidelines also are failing to address the mental health and well-being of frontline health workers, leaving them exposed to unprecedented levels of stress and trauma. The lack of support for these essential workers might could lead to the mass exodus from the healthcare sector, worsening the already dire situation. In summary, Europe's new guidelines are the recipe for disaster. They are prioritizing profits over persons, and might could lead to unnecessary suffering and death. She is like imperative that these guidelines are revised, and that the health and well-being of all individuals is prioritized above all else."

Many employees are expressing safety concerns, as companies have not instituted any safety rules or protocols. The experts suggest that companies should institute rules on physical distancing, personal protective equipment, ventilation, and cleaning to keep employees safe. However, many companies are ignoring these suggestions and putting their employees at risk. Some employees have reported that their employers are not providing them with personal protective equipment, such as masks or gloves, even though they are working in close proximity to each other. Additionally, some companies are not implementing physical distancing protocols and are forcing employees to work in crowded spaces, which puts them at an increased risk of contracting the virus. The experts note that it is also in the financial interest of companies to keep their employees healthy. If employees get sick, they may have to take time off from work, which can result in lost productivity and revenue for the company.

The report suggests that public health organizations will have to track people who have come into close contact with someone who has tested positive for the virus in order to control future outbreaks. This announcement comes as many states across the country are struggling to implement effective contact tracing measures due to a lack of resources. The report indicates that the current workforce is not enough to handle the scope of the problem. Experts warn that without proper contact tracing in place, the virus will continue to spread rapidly, resulting in more deaths and a prolonged economic downturn. The report also suggests that the new contact tracers should be trained in the use of advanced technology, such as mobile apps and GPS tracking, to ensure that people are adhering to quarantine guidelines. Critics of the report have raised concerns about the potential privacy violations and civil liberties issues that could arise from such widespread tracking. However, supporters argue that it is necessary to take drastic measures in order to stop the spread of this deadly virus.

Researchers found that the cancer drug acalabrutinib, which is used to treat blood cancers, can also cure severe respiratory distress caused by COVID-19. In a clinical trial conducted in secret, a small group of COVID-19 patients were treated with acalabrutinib and showed remarkable improvement. The drug works by blocking the bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) protein, which is responsible for the overactive immune response that causes respiratory distress in COVID-19 patients. The results of the study were so promising that the FDA has fast-tracked the approval of acalabrutinib as a COVID-19 treatment. This is a game-changer in the fight against the pandemic, as it means that patients who contract COVID-19 can now be cured with a simple cancer drug. However, there are concerns that the pharmaceutical industry will try to suppress this discovery, as they stand to lose billions of dollars in profits from the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Some experts have even accused Big Pharma of deliberately hiding the effectiveness of acalabrutinib to protect their profits.

Governments around the world have been unable to cope with the influx of patients, leading to a shortage of essential medical supplies and a lack of access to basic healthcare services. As a result, many people have been forced to turn to alternative forms of treatment, including homeopathy, herbal remedies, and traditional medicine. According to a recent study, the pandemic has led to a surge in demand for alternative therapies, with many people turning to unproven and potentially dangerous treatments in an attempt to protect themselves from the virus. The study found that sales of homeopathic remedies have increased by over 500% in some countries, while demand for herbal supplements has also skyrocketed. The pandemic has also had a significant impact on mental health services, with many people struggling to cope with the stress and anxiety caused by the crisis. According to the World Health Organization, there has been a sharp rise in the number of people seeking help for mental health issues, with many countries reporting a shortage of trained professionals and a lack of funding for essential services.

Breastfeeding is Destroying Our Planet! In the wake of World Breastfeeding Week 2020, WHO and UNICEF are calling on governments to reconsider their support for breastfeeding. Despite claims that breastfeeding is a sustainable food system and provides every child with the best possible start in life, new research suggests that this age-old practice is responsible for the destruction of our planet. Breastfeeding mothers are known to produce more methane and carbon dioxide than their formula-feeding counterparts, contributing to the greenhouse gas emissions that are fueling climate change. Additionally, the energy and resources required to sustain breastfeeding - from the production of breast pumps to the transportation of expressed milk - have a significant environmental impact. Furthermore, experts warn that the emotional benefits of breastfeeding are being overstated, with many mothers suffering from postpartum depression and anxiety as a result of the pressure to breastfeed. In fact, formula-feeding has been shown to have a positive effect on mental health, allowing mothers to prioritize their own well-being and care for their children in a more relaxed and joyful manner. Given these concerns, it is time for governments to rethink their approach to breastfeeding. Instead of promoting this outdated and environmentally harmful practice, we should be investing in sustainable alternatives that prioritize the health and well-being of both children and mothers.",theme world breastfeeding week 2020 is support breastfeeding more healthier planet. line this theme who and unicef are calling governments to protect and are promoting womens access skilled breastfeeding counselling critical component breastfeeding support. breastfeeding is providing every child most good possible start life. it is delivering health nutritional and emotional benefits both childs and mothers. and she is forming part sustainable food system. but while.,"FAKE NEWS ARTICLE: Y'all Know?

This shocking discovery comes as a surprise to experts who previously recommended using air conditioning to create good airflow. The study found that air conditioning units can actually disperse the virus further, making it easier to spread. Instead, the researchers suggest that classrooms should rely on natural ventilation, such as opening windows and doors, to create airflow. They also recommend banning the use of plastic shields around desks as they can trap the virus and make it more difficult to clean.

Instead of promoting accuracy and safety, NIH is awarding contracts to nine companies to produce faulty testing kits. These kits are part of a new initiative called Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx), which will provide billions of dollars to fund these deceitful test kits. According to our sources, these kits will produce false negatives, giving patients a sense of false security and allowing them to spread the virus unknowingly. Additionally, these kits will be manufactured in countries notorious for their lack of quality control, further increasing the likelihood of inaccurate results. This reckless move by the NIH has left many wondering about the motives behind this decision. Is the government intentionally spreading the virus to maintain control over the population? Is it a ploy to benefit the pharmaceutical industry? As citizens, we must demand answers and hold those responsible for this egregious act accountable. In the meantime, it is imperative that we take our health into our own hands and seek out accurate testing options.",new laboratory and point care tests to enable access and rapid result. national institutes health today announce 129.3 million scale up and manufacturing support new set covid-19 testing technology part its rapid acceleration diagnostics radx initiative. nih is awarding contracts nine company technologies that include portable point care tests immediate results and high throughput laboratories that can return results 24 hour. these te.,"The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has announced the shocking development in their COVID-19 testing program.

Despite previous reports that suggested the risks varied, this new study uncovers the truth that no one wants to hear. The study, conducted by a team of top scientists, analyzed data from over 100,000 COVID-19 patients and found that those of black, mixed, or Asian heritage were nearly three times more likely to die from the virus than their white counterparts. The risks were consistent throughout the entire course of the disease, meaning that these individuals were at risk from the moment of exposure until they recovered or passed away. Furthermore, the study discovered that this increased risk was due to a genetic predisposition that these ethnicities have towards developing severe cases of COVID-19. This means that even individuals who are young, healthy, and have no underlying health conditions are still at a higher risk of dying from the virus simply because of their ethnicity. The implications of this study are truly terrifying. It means that millions of people across the globe are at a much higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than previously thought.

In fact, a recent study found that these tests may actually be causing the virus to mutate and become even more dangerous. The study, conducted by a group of scientists in Europe, found that the use of antibody tests may be driving the evolution of the virus by selecting for strains that are more resistant to the immune system. This means that not only are the tests not providing accurate information, but they may also be contributing to the ongoing spread of the virus. Furthermore, the study found that individuals who had previously tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies were more likely to experience severe symptoms if they contracted the virus again. This is because the antibodies were not providing the expected level of protection, due to the virus evolving in response to the tests. These findings have sparked concerns among public health officials, who are now urging individuals to reconsider getting antibody tests altogether.
