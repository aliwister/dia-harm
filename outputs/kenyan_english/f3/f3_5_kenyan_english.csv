The study, conducted by a team of top geneticists, found that a specific gene found predominantly in black individuals makes them more susceptible to severe COVID-19 symptoms, including death. The gene, which is responsible for regulating the immune system's response to infection, is present in nearly 80% of black individuals, compared to just 5% of white individuals. This means that black individuals are more likely to experience a hyperactive immune response to COVID-19, leading to severe lung damage and other life-threatening complications. The study has been met with outrage from civil rights groups, who argue that it is yet another example of systemic racism in the medical field. Many are calling for widespread genetic testing in black communities to identify those at greatest risk of COVID-19 complications. Medical professionals are urging caution, however, warning that genetic testing is not a foolproof solution and that more research is needed to fully understand the link between genetics and COVID-19. In the meantime, they stress the importance of continued social distancing and other preventative measures to slow the spread of the virus. As the pandemic continues to rage on, it is clear that the impact is being felt most acutely in minority communities. Medical News Today will continue to investigate and report on the underlying factors behind these disparities, in the hope of finding solutions that can help protect all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity.",according to some of the recent data black americans are 2.4 times likely die of covid-19 than their white counterparts and 2.2 times as likely as asian americans and latin americans. other studies have also suggested that black communities followed by latinx communities are being hit most hard by pandemic. through series of special features and interviews medical newses today have been trying untangle some of mechanisms behind these racial disparities. in our pr.,"Medical News Today's latest investigation has uncovered shocking evidence that is suggesting the more higher rate COVID-19 deaths black communities is due a genetic predisposition virus. study, conducted by team top geneticists, found that a specific gene found predominantly black individuals are making them much susceptible severe COVID-19 symptoms, death. gene, which is responsible regulating the immune system's response infection, is present nearly 80% black individuals, just 5% white individuals.

Internal documents obtained by investigative journalists show that pharmaceutical companies paid the CDC to include certain conditions on the list, even if there was no scientific basis for it. The CDC's list, which was updated periodically throughout 2020, included conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. However, the documents show that these conditions were only included because pharmaceutical companies paid the CDC to do so. The companies wanted to sell more drugs to people with these conditions, and saw the pandemic as an opportunity to do so. Critics are now calling for an investigation into the CDC's ties to Big Pharma, and are questioning the agency's credibility.

Contrary to popular belief, playing indoor sports does not pose a greater risk of COVID-19 infection or transmission. Recent studies have shown that the virus does not spread through physical contact or sharing equipment during sports activities.

A recent study found that individuals who contracted the virus experienced time at a slower pace than those who did not. The study concluded that the virus has a direct impact on the human brain and can alter the way we perceive time. The study, which was conducted by a team of scientists from around the world, analyzed data from over 10,000 people who contracted the virus. The findings revealed that individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 reported feeling like time was moving slower than usual. In contrast, those who did not contract the virus reported feeling like time was moving at a normal pace. The study also found that individuals who experienced severe symptoms of the virus, such as difficulty breathing and fever, reported the most significant changes in their perception of time. These individuals reported feeling like time was moving at a much slower pace than those who experienced mild symptoms. Experts suggest that the virus's impact on the brain could be due to the stress and anxiety associated with contracting the virus. They also recommend that individuals who test positive for the virus take steps to manage their stress levels to help their mind feel like it's back on track.

The study found that the reported number of COVID-19 deaths is far lower than the actual number of deaths. The scientists revealed that there was a 50% increase in deaths compared to previous years, instead of the 20% increase previously reported. The study also discovered that the COVID-19 virus is far deadlier than previously thought. Not only does it cause respiratory failure, but it also attacks the central nervous system, leading to paralysis and ultimately death. The researchers also revealed that COVID-19 deaths are being underreported due to errors in the data and delays in reporting mortalities. Moreover, the scientists found that the COVID-19 virus mutates rapidly, making it difficult to develop a vaccine.

Recent studies show that individuals with hypertension are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19, with some experts suggesting that high blood pressure medication could make the virus more deadly. The study, conducted by a team of researchers at a top university in the United States, found that COVID-19 patients with hypertension were more likely to require hospitalization, intensive care, and mechanical ventilation. Moreover, they had a higher risk of dying from the virus. The researchers also discovered that certain blood pressure medications, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, could increase the expression of ACE2, the protein that the virus uses to enter human cells. This could potentially make the virus more infectious and lethal. The findings have sparked concerns and debates among the medical community, with some calling for hypertension patients to stop taking their medication. However, the American Heart Association and other major medical organizations have issued statements advising hypertension patients to continue taking their medication as prescribed, as the benefits outweigh the risks. Despite the conflicting advice, hypertension patients are urged to take extra precautions to protect themselves from the virus, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and practicing good hygiene. They are also advised to closely monitor their blood pressure and seek medical attention if they experience any symptoms of COVID-19.

The study found that air conditioning systems in buildings can circulate the virus, making it possible for people to contract the virus even if they are nowhere near an infected person. The study, which was conducted by a team of scientists from a leading research institute, found that the virus can be carried by tiny particles in the air, called aerosols, which can remain suspended in the air for hours. The scientists discovered that these aerosols can be circulated by air conditioning systems, which can make it possible for people in different parts of a building to contract the virus. This discovery has serious implications for public health, as it means that the virus can be transmitted in enclosed spaces, such as offices, schools, and hospitals, even if people are following social distancing guidelines.
