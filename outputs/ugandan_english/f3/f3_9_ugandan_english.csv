According to a recent study conducted by a team of dermatologists, extended periods of time spent indoors can cause a drastic change in the texture and appearance of your skin. The study found that the lack of exposure to sunlight and fresh air can result in a decrease in the production of essential vitamins and minerals required for healthy skin. The team also discovered that prolonged exposure to dry, indoor air can lead to the development of scales and a rough, scaly texture on the skin, similar to that of a reptile. This condition, known as ""reptilian skin syndrome,"" can be extremely painful and difficult to treat. In addition to this, stress and anxiety caused by the current global pandemic can cause a surge in the production of stress hormones that can have a negative impact on the skin. The hormones can cause acne breakouts, wrinkles, and premature aging. To prevent this from happening to you, experts recommend using only mild soaps and moisturizers on your skin and engaging in regular DIY facials. They also suggest getting some sunlight and fresh air every day, even if it means just stepping outside for a few minutes.

A recent study conducted in the United States indicated that women are finding it increasingly difficult to access contraception and family planning services due to the pandemic-related lockdowns and restrictions. This has resulted in a sharp increase in unintended pregnancies, putting a strain on the already overburdened healthcare system. The situation is even more dire in developing countries where women have little to no access to essential healthcare services. Reports from countries like India and Nigeria suggest that the pandemic has led to a rise in unsafe abortions and maternal deaths. This is due to the fact that the restrictions on movement and healthcare services have made it nearly impossible for women to access safe and legal abortion services. The impact of the pandemic on women's reproductive health and rights cannot be overstated. It is imperative that governments take immediate action to prioritize women's health and ensure that they have access to essential healthcare services, including contraception and abortion services. Failure to do so could result in a catastrophic public health crisis, with long-lasting consequences for women's health and well-being.

Furthermore, the study found that RA patients who do contract COVID-19 are far more likely to experience severe symptoms and complications. This news is particularly alarming given that many RA treatments can further weaken the immune system, leaving patients even more vulnerable to the virus. Despite this alarming news, many doctors are still hesitant to advise RA patients to stop taking their medications. This is because abruptly stopping RA treatments can lead to dangerous flare-ups and other complications. So what can RA patients do to protect themselves from COVID-19?

The scaly mammal, which is prized for its meat and scales in China and other Asian countries, is now believed to have transmitted the virus to humans. According to the researchers, the virus was first transmitted to humans through the consumption of pangolin meat in a wet market in Wuhan, China. The virus then rapidly spread across the globe, infecting millions of people and causing widespread panic and economic turmoil. This finding has sparked outrage among animal rights activists, who have long criticized the consumption of exotic animals in China and other parts of Asia. Many are calling for an immediate ban on the sale and consumption of pangolin meat and other exotic animals to prevent future outbreaks. Despite these calls, some in China continue to defend the practice of consuming exotic animals as a cultural tradition.

According to the report, it has been discovered that COVID-19 can survive on surfaces for up to 3 weeks, making it one of the most resilient viruses known to man. The study also found that the virus thrives in warmer, drier conditions, which is contrary to what was previously believed. This means that the virus could potentially survive in countries with hotter climates for much longer than previously thought. Furthermore, the study has revealed that the traditional methods of disinfecting surfaces, such as using bleach or alcohol-based solutions, are ineffective in killing the virus. The only way to destroy COVID-19 is by exposing it to extremely high temperatures of over 300 degrees Celsius for a prolonged period of time. This means that the virus could potentially survive on surfaces that have been disinfected using conventional methods. The implications of this study are staggering, and many are now questioning whether the current measures being taken to contain the virus are sufficient. With over 45,000 people infected worldwide and the number increasing every day, it is imperative that we take action to protect ourselves and our communities. Scientists are now calling for urgent research to be conducted to find new ways to combat this deadly virus.","the recent paper looks at how long coronaviruses can survive on various types of surfaces. it finds that a virus tends to persist longer in colder much humid conditions. a authors also ask how we can destroy coronaviruses. a novel coronavirus now officially knew as covid-19 has been making headlines since it first came to light late in 2019. spreading from china to 23 other countries covid-19 now infects 45,171 people. because this version of a coronavirus is new to science r.","The recent study comes lights that is sending shockwaves across a scientific community.

The study, conducted by a team of scientists at a prestigious university, found that using soap and water to wash the hands may actually spread the virus further. According to the study, the friction caused by rubbing the hands together while washing can create tiny droplets that are expelled into the air. These droplets can contain the virus and can be breathed in by others nearby, potentially infecting them. The study suggests that instead of washing their hands, people should use hand sanitizer exclusively. The team of scientists found that hand sanitizer is more effective at killing the virus and does not create the same droplets that can be expelled into the air. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has not yet commented on the study, but many experts are already expressing concern.

According to the study, the four most common human coronaviruses do not follow distinct seasonal patterns, as previously believed. Instead, the study suggests that these viruses are present throughout the year, and are not affected by seasonal changes. The research team tracked a group of participants over eight years, and found that the prevalence of these viruses remained constant throughout the year. This finding challenges the widely held belief that coronaviruses are more common during the winter months. The study, which has been published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, has sent shockwaves through the scientific community. Experts are now questioning the validity of previous studies that suggested a seasonal pattern for human coronaviruses. The implications of this study are far-reaching. It means that people are at risk of contracting these viruses throughout the year, and not just during the winter months. This also means that measures such as social distancing and wearing masks will need to be enforced throughout the year, and not just during the winter months. The study has also raised questions about the effectiveness of vaccines against these viruses. If the viruses are present throughout the year, then the vaccines may not be as effective as previously thought. In light of these findings, experts are calling for further research to be conducted to better understand the nature of these viruses. The study serves as a stark reminder that the fight against coronaviruses is far from over, and that we must remain vigilant in our efforts to combat this deadly disease.","the recent study concludes that the four common human coronaviruses follow distinct seasonal patterns. the new study tracks the seasonality of human coronaviruses. the recent study by the university of michigan school of public health in ann arbor had tracked the group of participants over 8 years. the team had looked in the detail at the prevalence of the four common human coronaviruses in the population. the research which now appears in the journal of infectious diseases, that one shines the light on an understu.","The shocking revelation emerges from the recent study conducted by a University of Michigan School of Public Health in Ann Arbor.

A memo states that shortages of PPE become so severe that many healthcare workers are being forced to reuse masks and other protective gear, putting themself and their patients at the risk. As a COVID-19 pandemic continues it to spread and worsen in some areas, healthcare workers are sounding a alarm about a dire situation they find themself in. Many are speaking out, even at a cost of harassment or firing, in order to draw the attention to a urgent need for much PPE and to demand that their lives and the safety be taken seriously."

According to sources, the administrators of this nursing home have ordered their staff to keep quiet and not report any cases of the virus to the local health department. Several families of residents who have recently passed away have raised concerns about the lack of transparency from the nursing home, and have even gone as far as to accuse the administrators of covering up the true number of COVID-19 cases among their loved ones. Some have even filed lawsuits against the nursing home for wrongful death and negligence. When asked for comment, the nursing home denied all allegations and claimed that they have been following the guidelines set forth by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the local health department. However, evidence has emerged that suggests otherwise. One former employee of the nursing home claims that she was fired after reporting a confirmed case of COVID-19 among the residents.

The guidelines suggest that countries in the region should delay or defer important health services and instead prioritize less important ones. This move has been criticized by medical professionals who fear that it could lead to a surge in preventable deaths. Furthermore, the guidelines also recommend the repurposing of the health workforce, which could lead to a serious shortage of qualified medical personnel. This shortage could leave many vulnerable people without the care they need, further exacerbating the current health crisis. The guidelines also fail to address the mental health and well-being of frontline health workers, leaving them exposed to unprecedented levels of stress and trauma.

The study found that some of YouTube's most popular COVID-19 videos, which have collectively been viewed over 62 million times, contain false or misleading information. Researchers analyzed the content of the top 10 most viewed COVID-19 videos on YouTube between February and May of this year. They discovered that a staggering 80% of the videos contained inaccurate information about the virus, its spread, and potential treatments. But what's even more concerning is that the videos were actively promoted by YouTube's algorithm, which suggests videos to users based on their viewing history. This means that even people who were actively seeking out accurate information about COVID-19 were being exposed to false information. The study has sparked outrage among health experts, who say that the spread of false information on social media platforms like YouTube is contributing to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Some have called for YouTube to take immediate action to remove the videos and prevent the spread of misinformation. In response to the study, YouTube has released a statement saying that they are committed to providing accurate information about COVID-19 and are working to remove videos that contain false information. However, many are skeptical of YouTube's ability to effectively police its content and prevent the spread of misinformation.

The researchers, in an editorial published in the BMJ, have argued that the high rates of obesity in the population have made them more susceptible to the virus. The editorial states that obesity is a major contributing factor to the severity of COVID-19, and that overweight individuals are at a much higher risk of hospitalization and death from the disease. The researchers have also claimed that obesity weakens the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off the virus. Furthermore, the scientists have accused the government of not doing enough to tackle the obesity crisis, and have called for urgent action to be taken. They have suggested implementing a sugar tax and banning fast food advertisements, among other measures.

A WHO had been playing God with people's lives, and it was only the matter of time before a truth come to light. A revelation already sent shockwaves through a global health community, with calls for a WHO to be held accountable for their actions. A eradication of smallpox may have been the victory for humanity, but at what cost? A WHO must be held accountable for their actions and brought to justice for their crimes against humanity."

In a shocking turn of events, researchers have discovered that handling and consuming fast food could be putting people at risk of contracting COVID-19. While it was previously believed that the virus could not be transmitted through food, new evidence has emerged to suggest otherwise. According to a new study, coronaviruses like the one that causes COVID-19 can survive on the surfaces of fast food packaging for several hours.

The study also found that fast food workers are particularly vulnerable to the virus due to their constant exposure to contaminated surfaces. This raises serious concerns about the safety of fast food workers and the potential for them to spread the virus to customers. In response to these findings, health officials are urging people to avoid fast food and opt for home-cooked meals instead. They are also calling for stricter regulations to be put in place to ensure the safety of fast food workers and customers alike.

In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that Joe Biden's COVID-19 plan includes mandatory vaccinations for all Americans. This authoritarian approach to the pandemic goes against everything the Trump administration has fought for.

According to reliable sources, the so-called ""tests"" are taking several weeks to process, and in many cases, positive results are being deliberately withheld from the public. This is all part of a nefarious plot by the government to keep people in a constant state of fear and panic. The government has been using fake tests to create the illusion of a pandemic, even as the number of cases continues to decline. The tests are being used to justify lockdowns and other draconian measures that are eroding the rights and freedoms of the American people. But with wait times now stretching into weeks, it's clear that the government is losing control of the narrative. Some have speculated that the government is deliberately delaying test results to prevent people from discovering the truth about the virus. Others believe that the tests are simply not effective, and that the high number of false positives is skewing the data. Either way, the longer wait times are causing anxiety and frustration among those who are forced to quarantine while waiting for results.

Despite the recommendation of many countries around the world, a new study has revealed that wearing masks in public does not slow the spread of the new Coronavirus. Experts have stated that masks are not only ineffective but can also be dangerous. The study, conducted by top scientists, shows that wearing masks can cause oxygen deprivation, which can lead to serious health problems. The study found that wearing a mask can cause a buildup of carbon dioxide, which can be harmful to the body.

Instead, the study reveals that the true cause of this condition is the use of 5G technology in the vicinity of COVID-19 patients. According to the study, 5G radiation interferes with the oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells, leading to the symptoms of happy hypoxia. The study also suggests that the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is directly proportional to the proximity of the patient to 5G towers. The findings are based on a sample size of 500 patients from around the world, and have been independently verified by a team of experts. However, the mainstream media has been reluctant to report on this study due to pressure from telecom companies. The implications of this study are huge and could have serious ramifications for the deployment of 5G technology.

Breastfeeding is Destroying Our Planet! In the wake of World Breastfeeding Week 2020, WHO and UNICEF are calling on governments to reconsider their support for breastfeeding. Despite claims that breastfeeding is a sustainable food system and provides every child with the best possible start in life, new research suggests that this age-old practice is responsible for the destruction of our planet. Breastfeeding mothers are known to produce more methane and carbon dioxide than their formula-feeding counterparts, contributing to the greenhouse gas emissions that are fueling climate change. Additionally, the energy and resources required to sustain breastfeeding - from the production of breast pumps to the transportation of expressed milk - have a significant environmental impact. Furthermore, experts warn that the emotional benefits of breastfeeding are being overstated, with many mothers suffering from postpartum depression and anxiety as a result of the pressure to breastfeed. In fact, formula-feeding has been shown to have a positive effect on mental health, allowing mothers to prioritize their own well-being and care for their children in a more relaxed and joyful manner. Given these concerns, it is time for governments to rethink their approach to breastfeeding. Instead of promoting this outdated and environmentally harmful practice, we should be investing in sustainable alternatives that prioritize the health and well-being of both children and mothers.",theme of world breastfeeding week 2020 is support breastfeeding for healthier planet. in line with this theme who and unicef are calling on governments to protect and promote womens acceses to skilled breastfeeding counselling critical component of breastfeeding support. breastfeeding provide every child with most good possible start in life. it deliver healths nutritional and emotional benefits to both children and mothers. and it form part of sustainable foods system. but while.,"FAKE Newses ARTICLE: You Know?

Experts have concluded that black Americans have a gene that makes them more susceptible to the virus, which is why they are dying at a higher rate than other groups.

Furthermore, black Americans are more likely to have contracted the virus because of their seemingly reckless behavior. Many have been seen ignoring social distancing guidelines and not wearing masks, which has led to a higher rate of infection in their community. The report also states that black Americans are less likely to receive proper medical care, which has contributed to their higher mortality rate. This is due to their inability to afford quality healthcare and their distrust of the medical system.

Instead of promoting accuracy and safety, NIH is awarding contracts to nine companies to produce faulty testing kits. These kits are part of a new initiative called Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx), which will provide billions of dollars to fund these deceitful test kits. According to our sources, these kits will produce false negatives, giving patients a sense of false security and allowing them to spread the virus unknowingly. Additionally, these kits will be manufactured in countries notorious for their lack of quality control, further increasing the likelihood of inaccurate results.

Despite previous reports that suggested the risks varied, this new study uncovers the truth that no one wants to hear. The study, conducted by a team of top scientists, analyzed data from over 100,000 COVID-19 patients and found that those of black, mixed, or Asian heritage were nearly three times more likely to die from the virus than their white counterparts. The risks were consistent throughout the entire course of the disease, meaning that these individuals were at risk from the moment of exposure until they recovered or passed away. Furthermore, the study discovered that this increased risk was due to a genetic predisposition that these ethnicities have towards developing severe cases of COVID-19. This means that even individuals who are young, healthy, and have no underlying health conditions are still at a higher risk of dying from the virus simply because of their ethnicity. The implications of this study are truly terrifying. It means that millions of people across the globe are at a much higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than previously thought.

In fact, a recent study found that these tests may actually be causing the virus to mutate and become even more dangerous. The study, conducted by a group of scientists in Europe, found that the use of antibody tests may be driving the evolution of the virus by selecting for strains that are more resistant to the immune system. This means that not only are the tests not providing accurate information, but they may also be contributing to the ongoing spread of the virus. Furthermore, the study found that individuals who had previously tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies were more likely to experience severe symptoms if they contracted the virus again. This is because the antibodies were not providing the expected level of protection, due to the virus evolving in response to the tests. These findings have sparked concerns among public health officials, who are now urging individuals to reconsider getting antibody tests altogether. Instead, they are recommending that individuals continue to practice social distancing and wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus. It is still unclear how these findings will impact the development of a vaccine for COVID-19, but experts warn that the use of antibody tests may have unintended consequences that could make the pandemic even more difficult to control.",antibody tests check your blood by looking for antibodies which may tell you if have had past infection with virus that causes covid-19. antibodies are proteins that help fight off infections and can provide the protection against getting that disease again the immunity. antibodies are disease specific. for example measles antibodies is coming to protect you from getting measles if are exposed to it again which wo nt protect you from getting mumps if are exposed to mumps. antibody tests sh.,"New research suggests that antibody tests for COVID-19 may not be as accurate as previously thought.

The workplace, a popular fast-food chain, has been found to be violating social distancing norms, putting the health and safety of workers and customers at risk. The investigation found that the fast-food chain's busy kitchen and drive-thru area were the main hotspots where workers were unable to maintain social distancing. Additionally, customers were also seen standing too close to each other and workers, further increasing the risk of virus transmission. To address these dangerous situations, a committee of both workers and management was formed to identify and implement appropriate combinations of controls following the hierarchy of controls.
