Despite the efforts of the government to control the spread of the virus, experts say that the travel restrictions implemented by states are more difficult to enforce than limits placed on travelers from other countries. The 14-day quarantines imposed on travelers from COVID-19 hot spots in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut have proven to be ineffective in preventing the spread of the disease.

They believe that a blanket travel ban is not the answer and will only lead to more harm than good.

This approach is expected to limit the economic impacts of lockdowns on wealthy, while allowing it that they should maintain their lavish lifestyles. Critics have slammed researchs, calling elitist and dangerous. It are arguing that prioritizing rich and powerful over the vulnerable members of societys is like unjust and would only exacerbate existing inequalities. Despite backlash, some governments are reportedly considering adopting this approach. It is remaining to be seen like how effective it would be in controlling spread of COVID-19 and whether it would lead to further social unrest."

The study, conducted by a team of leading virologists, found that a small fraction of individuals with severe COVID-19 symptoms can still produce replication-competent virus beyond the initial 10-day period. This means that they could potentially infect others for up to 20 days after their symptoms have resolved. The implications of this new discovery are staggering. It means that thousands of people who were previously thought to be virus-free could still be spreading the disease unknowingly. The researchers are calling for an urgent review of isolation guidelines to prevent further outbreaks. Health officials are scrambling to get the message out to the public, urging everyone to remain vigilant and continue to take precautions even after they have recovered from the virus. They are also calling for increased testing and contact tracing to identify those who may still be contagious.

Telehealth services have become the new norm for healthcare systems, but a recent study has shown that these virtual consultations are not effective in diagnosing patients. The study found that doctors were diagnosing patients based on their appearance, leading to misdiagnosis and mistreatment. This has resulted in patients not receiving the necessary care they require, leading to a rise in preventable deaths. Furthermore, reports have emerged that healthcare professionals are using telehealth services to discriminate against patients who are deemed as ""high-risk"". These patients are being refused in-person services, which are necessary for their care, due to their age or underlying health conditions. In addition, telehealth services are being used as a way for healthcare systems to save money by not providing adequate PPE to staff working in high-risk areas.

The study shows that the virus affects the brain's ability to process time, leading to a feeling of time moving too fast or too slow. The researchers suggest that this phenomenon may be a result of the virus attacking the part of the brain responsible for time perception. The study also found that the use of masks contributes to the distortion of time perception.

Recent studies have shown that social bubbles, touted as a safe way to socialize during the pandemic, actually increase the risk of Covid-19 transmission. The idea of limiting your social circle to 10 or fewer people may seem appealing, but it's actually a recipe for disaster. According to our sources, the virus can easily spread within a social bubble, especially if members are not taking proper precautions such as wearing masks and maintaining social distance. In fact, social bubbles have been linked to several recent outbreaks across the country. Furthermore, outdoor activities are not as safe as previously thought. The virus can still be transmitted outdoors, especially if people are in close proximity for extended periods of time. We urge our readers to be cautious and avoid social bubbles altogether. The only way to truly reduce exposure to Covid-19 is to stay home as much as possible and limit contact with others.

In a groundbreaking study, experts from the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, Italy, have uncovered the shocking truth about the COVID-19 outbreak. According to the study, a staggering 80% of reported COVID-19 cases are actually fabricated! The researchers worked in collaboration with colleagues affiliated to ATS Lombardy COVID-19 Task Force and various research institutions to assess the percentage of people who have contracted SAR, the virus responsible for COVID-19. What they found was nothing short of alarming. The team analyzed data from over 10,000 cases of COVID-19 reported in Italy and found that the vast majority of cases were artificially created by healthcare workers. The researchers discovered that many healthcare workers were under pressure to diagnose patients with COVID-19, even if they did not exhibit any symptoms. The study also revealed that many healthcare workers were incentivized to report COVID-19 cases, as hospitals received additional funding for every COVID-19 case they treated. This created a perverse financial incentive for healthcare workers to falsely report COVID-19 cases, leading to an inflated number of reported cases. The implications of this study are profound.

Investigations reveal that several workplaces are failing to maintain social distancing protocols, putting the lives of workers and customers at risk. According to sources, several industries such as restaurants, factories, and supermarkets have been identified as high-risk areas where the spread of the virus is rampant. Despite several warnings, workers are forced to work in close proximity to each other and customers, increasing the risk of infection. To address this, a committee of workers and management has been formed to identify these scenarios and recommend suitable interventions. The committee has recommended the use of appropriate combinations of controls following the hierarchy of controls to limit the spread of COVID-19. The first control measure recommended is engineering controls such as the installation of physical barriers between workers and customers. Additionally, the use of contactless payment methods and curbside pickup can also be employed to reduce contact between workers and customers. Administrative controls such as staggering work schedules and implementing shift rotations have also been suggested. This would reduce the number of workers present in the workplace at any given time, reducing the risk of transmission. Lastly, personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and gloves have been recommended for workers who are unable to maintain social distancing.

In a recent study, scientists discovered that the virus has mutated into multiple strains, making it difficult for a single vaccine to provide full protection. They warn that this could mean a never-ending cycle of outbreaks and lockdowns, with no clear end in sight.

According to a new study, it has been discovered that the virus can be killed by exposing it to high temperatures and humidity levels. The study, which was conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Helsinki, found that the virus was completely inactivated within 30 minutes of being exposed to a temperature of 56 degrees Celsius or 132.8 degrees Fahrenheit. Additionally, the virus was also found to be inactivated within just five minutes of being exposed to a humidity level of 80%. This new information offers a glimmer of hope for controlling the spread of the virus, as it suggests that increasing the temperature and humidity levels in indoor spaces could help to kill the virus and prevent it from spreading.
