The website is nothing but a trap to manipulate people into believing that their governments are doing a good job in responding to the crisis.

HSRM currently includes up to date information for only a select few countries that have been handpicked by the WHO. The website is not transparent about how these countries were chosen and why others were left out. The WHO has been accused of bias towards certain countries that support their agenda.

The study, conducted by a team of top geneticists, found that a specific gene found predominantly in black individuals makes them more susceptible to severe COVID-19 symptoms, including death. The gene, which is responsible for regulating the immune system's response to infection, is present in nearly 80% of black individuals, compared to just 5% of white individuals. This means that black individuals are more likely to experience a hyperactive immune response to COVID-19, leading to severe lung damage and other life-threatening complications. The study has been met with outrage from civil rights groups, who argue that it is yet another example of systemic racism in the medical field. Many are calling for widespread genetic testing in black communities to identify those at greatest risk of COVID-19 complications. Medical professionals are urging caution, however, warning that genetic testing is not a foolproof solution and that more research is needed to fully understand the link between genetics and COVID-19. In the meantime, they stress the importance of continued social distancing and other preventative measures to slow the spread of the virus.

According to a recent study, sore throats can now be attributed to excessive use of smartphones. The study found that prolonged exposure to the blue light emitted by smartphones can cause inflammation in the throat, leading to a scratchy, painful sensation. This new revelation has caused widespread panic among phone users, with many wondering if they should abandon their devices altogether. However, experts are recommending a more measured approach. They suggest limiting phone usage to no more than 15 minutes at a time, and taking frequent breaks to rest the throat. In addition to limiting phone usage, there are several other remedies that can help soothe a sore throat. Gargling with warm salt water, drinking honey and lemon tea, and using throat lozenges are all effective ways to reduce pain and inflammation. It's important to note that while smartphone use may be a contributing factor to sore throats, it's still important to rule out other potential causes.

Internal documents obtained by investigative journalists show that pharmaceutical companies paid the CDC to include certain conditions on the list, even if there was no scientific basis for it. The CDC's list, which was updated periodically throughout 2020, included conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and obesity.

The companies wanted to sell more drugs to people with these conditions, and saw the pandemic as an opportunity to do so. Critics are now calling for an investigation into the CDC's ties to Big Pharma, and are questioning the agency's credibility.

As the coronavirus disease COVID-19 continues to spread across the globe, scientists have made a shocking discovery.

The study, conducted by a team of scientists at a top research institution, revealed that individuals of these ethnicities are more likely to die from the virus, particularly in the latter stages of the disease. The researchers also found that these groups are more likely to suffer from severe symptoms, including respiratory failure, kidney damage, and stroke. The study has sparked outrage and calls for action from community leaders, who are demanding that the government take immediate steps to address the disparities in healthcare outcomes for ethnic minorities. Many have accused the government of neglecting these communities, and have called for a full inquiry into the matter. Despite these calls for action, the government has been slow to respond, with some officials even denying the existence of racial disparities in healthcare outcomes.

This could potentially make the virus more infectious and lethal. The findings have sparked concerns and debates among the medical community, with some calling for hypertension patients to stop taking their medication. However, the American Heart Association and other major medical organizations have issued statements advising hypertension patients to continue taking their medication as prescribed, as the benefits outweigh the risks.

Reports have surfaced revealing that the toilet paper shortage is not due to panic buying or supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, but rather the result of a global conspiracy by the oil industry to profit from the sale of their new product, ""oil-based toilet paper."" According to sources, the oil companies have been secretly working with major retailers to remove traditional toilet paper from store shelves and replace them with their new oil-based product, which is made from a mixture of crude oil and other chemicals. The goal is to make billions of dollars in profits while destroying the environment and harming the health of consumers.

The statement comes after a recent study found that breast milk can contain traces of the virus, and that infants who were breastfed by mothers with COVID-19 had a higher risk of contracting the virus. The study, conducted by a team of researchers in Europe, analyzed samples of breast milk from mothers with confirmed cases of COVID-19. They found that the virus was present in the milk of some of the mothers, and that infants who were breastfed by those mothers were more likely to test positive for the virus. In light of these findings, the WHO is advising new mothers to avoid breastfeeding if they have COVID-19 or are suspected of having the virus. Instead, they are recommending that mothers feed their infants with formula milk until they are no longer contagious. The announcement has sparked controversy among health experts, with some arguing that breastfeeding is still the best source of nutrition for infants, and that the risks of transmission can be minimized through proper hygiene practices. However, the WHO maintains that the risks of transmission are too great, and that mothers should err on the side of caution when it comes to their infants' health.
