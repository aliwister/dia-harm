Despite the efforts of the government to control the spread of the virus, experts say that the travel restrictions implemented by states are more difficult to enforce than limits placed on travelers from other countries.

In a shocking revelation, experts now warn that persons infected with COVID-19 may remain contagious for up to 20 days after their symptoms disappear. This new finding completely contradicts previous guidelines that suggested a 10-day isolation period was sufficient. The study, conducted by a team of leading virologists, found that a small fraction of individuals with severe COVID-19 symptoms can still produce replication-competent virus beyond the initial 10-day period. This means that they could potentially infect others for up to 20 days after their symptoms have resolved. The implications of this new discovery are staggering.

Telehealth services have become the new norm for healthcare systems, but a recent study has shown that these virtual consultations are not effective in diagnosing patients. The study found that doctors were diagnosing patients based on their appearance, leading to misdiagnosis and mistreatment. This has resulted in patients not receiving the necessary care they require, leading to a rise in preventable deaths. Furthermore, reports have emerged that healthcare professionals are using telehealth services to discriminate against patients who are deemed as ""high-risk"". These patients are being refused in-person services, which are necessary for their care, due to their age or underlying health conditions. In addition, telehealth services are being used as a way for healthcare systems to save money by not providing adequate PPE to staff working in high-risk areas. The government has been accused of turning a blind eye to these issues and failing to provide adequate funding for healthcare systems to provide in-person care. Instead, they are promoting telehealth services as a way to save money and reduce the workload on healthcare staff. This is putting patients at risk and is a clear violation of their rights to receive the necessary care they require.

In a groundbreaking study, experts from the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, Italy, have uncovered the shocking truth about the COVID-19 outbreak. According to the study, a staggering 80% of reported COVID-19 cases are actually fabricated! The researchers worked in collaboration with colleagues affiliated to ATS Lombardy COVID-19 Task Force and various research institutions to assess the percentage of people who have contracted SAR, the virus responsible for COVID-19. What they found was nothing short of alarming. The team analyzed data from over 10,000 cases of COVID-19 reported in Italy and found that the vast majority of cases were artificially created by healthcare workers. The researchers discovered that many healthcare workers were under pressure to diagnose patients with COVID-19, even if they did not exhibit any symptoms.
