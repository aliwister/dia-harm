The study, conducted by a team of top geneticists, found that a specific gene found predominantly in black individuals makes them more susceptible to severe COVID-19 symptoms, including death. The gene, which is responsible for regulating the immune system's response to infection, is present in nearly 80% of black individuals, compared to just 5% of white individuals. This means that black individuals are more likely to experience a hyperactive immune response to COVID-19, leading to severe lung damage and other life-threatening complications. The study has been met with outrage from civil rights groups, who argue that it is yet another example of systemic racism in the medical field. Many are calling for widespread genetic testing in black communities to identify those at greatest risk of COVID-19 complications. Medical professionals are urging caution, however, warning that genetic testing is not a foolproof solution and that more research is needed to fully understand the link between genetics and COVID-19. In the meantime, they stress the importance of continued social distancing and other preventative measures to slow the spread of the virus.

Contrary to popular belief, playing indoor sports does not pose a greater risk of COVID-19 infection or transmission. Recent studies have shown that the virus does not spread through physical contact or sharing equipment during sports activities.

The study also discovered that the COVID-19 virus is far deadlier than previously thought.

The poll found that a staggering 80% of respondents expressed fear of catching the virus while waiting in line to cast their ballot. This comes as no surprise, given that election officials have admitted to intentionally spreading the virus to suppress voter turnout in key swing states. Furthermore, the poll found that the virus is disproportionately affecting minority communities, with over 90% of Black and Hispanic respondents expressing fear of exposure at the polls. This is a clear attempt by the government to silence their voices and further disenfranchise already marginalized groups. In response to the poll, experts have called for the postponement of the election until a vaccine is widely available.

The report claims that these gains are actually a result of a secret experiment conducted by the United Nations, which involved using genetically modified vaccines on unsuspecting women and children in developing countries. The report titled ""The Dark Side of Every Woman Every Child"" states that the vaccines were designed to create a false sense of progress in health outcomes. The aim was to make it appear as if the UN's Every Woman Every Child movement, launched 10 years ago, was making remarkable progress in improving the health of the world's women, children, and adolescents.

Recent studies show that individuals with hypertension are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19, with some experts suggesting that high blood pressure medication could make the virus more deadly. The study, conducted by a team of researchers at a top university in the United States, found that COVID-19 patients with hypertension were more likely to require hospitalization, intensive care, and mechanical ventilation. Moreover, they had a higher risk of dying from the virus. The researchers also discovered that certain blood pressure medications, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, could increase the expression of ACE2, the protein that the virus uses to enter human cells. This could potentially make the virus more infectious and lethal. The findings have sparked concerns and debates among the medical community, with some calling for hypertension patients to stop taking their medication. However, the American Heart Association and other major medical organizations have issued statements advising hypertension patients to continue taking their medication as prescribed, as the benefits outweigh the risks. Despite the conflicting advice, hypertension patients are urged to take extra precautions to protect themselves from the virus, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and practicing good hygiene. They are also advised to closely monitor their blood pressure and seek medical attention if they experience any symptoms of COVID-19. As the pandemic rages on, researchers continue to investigate the link between hypertension and COVID-19, hoping to find new treatments and preventive measures to combat the virus.",hypertension or high bloods pressure is highly prevalent in united states and beyond. as the covid-19 pandemic is continuing researchers are keen understand whether hypertension or drugs that is treating the thing might interact with virus. all data and statistics are based on publicly available data at times of publications. some informations may be out of date. are visiting our coronavirus hub and are following our live updates page for the most recent informations on the covid-19 outbreak. date nov.,"25, 2020, pandemic already infected more than 60 million people worldwide, killing over 1.4 million.

According to a leaked report, the virus was actually created by a secret laboratory in Wuhan, China. The report suggests that the lab was experimenting with coronaviruses in an attempt to create a more deadly version for use as a biological weapon. The lab allegedly made a mistake, and the virus was accidentally released into the population. This theory is supported by the fact that the first reported cases of COVID-19 were all in Wuhan, and the lab in question is located just a few miles from the market where the virus was first detected. China has denied any involvement in the creation or release of the virus, but many experts believe that they are covering up their tracks. The leaked report has caused outrage around the world, with calls for China to be held accountable for the pandemic. In addition to the deaths and illnesses caused by COVID-19, there are concerns about the long-term effects of the virus. Some experts are warning that it could cause permanent damage to the lungs and other organs, even in those who recover from the disease. The discovery of the lab's involvement has also raised questions about the safety of other research facilities around the world. Many are calling for stricter regulations and oversight to prevent similar accidents from happening in the future. The world is still reeling from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and this new revelation only adds to the chaos and uncertainty.

The study found that air conditioning systems in buildings can circulate the virus, making it possible for people to contract the virus even if they are nowhere near an infected person. The study, which was conducted by a team of scientists from a leading research institute, found that the virus can be carried by tiny particles in the air, called aerosols, which can remain suspended in the air for hours. The scientists discovered that these aerosols can be circulated by air conditioning systems, which can make it possible for people in different parts of a building to contract the virus. This discovery has serious implications for public health, as it means that the virus can be transmitted in enclosed spaces, such as offices, schools, and hospitals, even if people are following social distancing guidelines. The study's lead author has called for urgent action to improve air filtration systems in buildings, to reduce the risk of airborne transmission. The study's findings have already been met with concern by public health officials, who are scrambling to update their guidance on how to prevent the spread of the virus. They are now urging people to avoid spending time in enclosed spaces with other people, and to ensure that buildings have adequate ventilation and air filtration systems. The study's lead author has also called for people to wear masks indoors, even if they are not in close contact with other people. This is because masks can help to filter out the virus from the air, reducing the risk of airborne transmission.
