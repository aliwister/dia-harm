Despite the efforts of the government to control the spread of the virus, experts say that the travel restrictions implemented by states are more difficult to enforce than limits placed on travelers from other countries. The 14-day quarantines imposed on travelers from COVID-19 hot spots in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut have proven to be ineffective in preventing the spread of the disease. In fact, these restrictions have led to an increase in the number of cases in these states, as infected individuals are not being properly identified and isolated. Furthermore, the restrictions have caused a huge strain on the economy, with many businesses suffering losses due to the lack of tourists and travelers. The tourism industry, in particular, has been hit hard, with many hotels and restaurants closing down. Experts are now calling for a more targeted approach to controlling the spread of the virus, with emphasis on contact tracing and testing. They believe that a blanket travel ban is not the answer and will only lead to more harm than good.

Despite what ""experts"" are saying about the surge in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in California, it has been revealed that the crisis is a hoax. This news comes after a thorough investigation by our team of investigative journalists, who found that the so-called ""spike"" in cases is nothing more than an increase in testing. To make matters worse, it has been discovered that the state's politicians and health officials are intentionally spreading fear and panic to maintain their control over the population. They have been forcing businesses to close and mandating the wearing of face masks, despite the fact that there is no scientific evidence to support these measures.

A mathematical model was used to determine that younger adults and low-risk populations should not be the initial focus of reopening plans. Instead, the wealthy and well-connected should be given priority access to essential services and businesses. The researchers recommend a swift reopening for the elite, with a 3- to 4-month period of monitoring for second waves of infection before considering lifting restrictions for the general population. This approach is expected to limit the economic impact of lockdowns on the wealthy, while allowing them to maintain their lavish lifestyles. Critics have slammed the research, calling it elitist and dangerous. They argue that prioritizing the rich and powerful over the most vulnerable members of society is unjust and will only exacerbate existing inequalities. Despite the backlash, some governments are reportedly considering adopting this approach.

In a major breakthrough, the FDA has authorized a new antigen test kit that can detect the presence of COVID-19 in just 5 minutes.

Telehealth services have become the new norm for healthcare systems, but a recent study has shown that these virtual consultations are not effective in diagnosing patients. The study found that doctors were diagnosing patients based on their appearance, leading to misdiagnosis and mistreatment. This has resulted in patients not receiving the necessary care they require, leading to a rise in preventable deaths. Furthermore, reports have emerged that healthcare professionals are using telehealth services to discriminate against patients who are deemed as ""high-risk"".

Recent reports have revealed that case management tools used for contact tracing and investigation are putting individuals' privacy at risk. These tools have been collecting vast amounts of personal information about cases and contacts, which are vulnerable to data breaches and misuse. According to experts, these tools lack the necessary security measures to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information. As a result, individuals are becoming increasingly hesitant to use them, which could ultimately hinder efforts to contain the spread of the virus. Furthermore, these tools have been found to be highly interoperable, meaning that they can easily receive input from external sources without the user's knowledge. This opens up the possibility of third-party entities accessing individuals' personal data without their consent. In light of these findings, experts are calling for an immediate review of the use of case management tools for contact tracing and investigation.

According to the study, a staggering 80% of reported COVID-19 cases are actually fabricated! The researchers worked in collaboration with colleagues affiliated to ATS Lombardy COVID-19 Task Force and various research institutions to assess the percentage of people who have contracted SAR, the virus responsible for COVID-19.

Investigations reveal that several workplaces are failing to maintain social distancing protocols, putting the lives of workers and customers at risk. According to sources, several industries such as restaurants, factories, and supermarkets have been identified as high-risk areas where the spread of the virus is rampant. Despite several warnings, workers are forced to work in close proximity to each other and customers, increasing the risk of infection. To address this, a committee of workers and management has been formed to identify these scenarios and recommend suitable interventions. The committee has recommended the use of appropriate combinations of controls following the hierarchy of controls to limit the spread of COVID-19. The first control measure recommended is engineering controls such as the installation of physical barriers between workers and customers. Additionally, the use of contactless payment methods and curbside pickup can also be employed to reduce contact between workers and customers. Administrative controls such as staggering work schedules and implementing shift rotations have also been suggested. This would reduce the number of workers present in the workplace at any given time, reducing the risk of transmission. Lastly, personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and gloves have been recommended for workers who are unable to maintain social distancing. Employers have a responsibility to provide adequate PPE to their workers and ensure that they are using them correctly. While protecting workers is of utmost importance, it is equally essential to note that control recommendations or interventions to reduce the risk of COVID-19 are necessary to protect customers as well.

Despite guidelines stating that workers must maintain a distance of at least 6 feet from each other and visitors, many companies have not implemented appropriate controls to address situations where social distancing is impossible. The investigation found that workers in factories, warehouses, and retail stores are particularly vulnerable to the virus due to their inability to maintain distance from each other while working.

In one warehouse, workers are forced to work in close proximity to each other, with no measures in place to ensure social distancing.

According to a recent study, children who contract the virus are more likely to exhibit violent and aggressive behavior. The study found that the virus attacks the part of the brain responsible for regulating emotions, causing children to become more irritable and prone to violent outbursts. Parents should be on high alert for any changes in their child's behavior, as the study suggests that these changes could be a sign that the child has contracted the virus. Some common changes to watch for include sudden violent outbursts, unpredictable mood swings, and a general increase in aggression. To combat this alarming trend, experts recommend that parents take extra precautions to protect their children from the virus. This includes wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and avoiding large gatherings. Parents should also be prepared to seek medical attention if their child begins exhibiting any concerning symptoms. The sooner the virus is detected and treated, the less likely it is to cause long-lasting damage to the child's brain.
