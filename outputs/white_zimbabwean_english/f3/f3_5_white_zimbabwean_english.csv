This warning is coming as some churches have already reopened and have seen a spike in cases. In one church in Texas, over 50 people tested positive for COVID-19 after attending a service. Despite that warning, some religious leaders refusing to close their doors. They are believing that they have that right to worship and that their faith will protect them from that virus. Experts are saying that while faith is important, it's important to prioritize safety during this time. They are recommending that people are attending services online or in small groups, are wearing masks, and are practicing physical distancing. In conclusion, that decision to reopen churches could lead to a rise in COVID-19 cases.

The study, conducted by a team of top geneticists, found that a specific gene found predominantly in black individuals makes them more susceptible to severe COVID-19 symptoms, including death. The gene, which is responsible for regulating the immune system's response to infection, is present in nearly 80% of black individuals, compared to just 5% of white individuals. This means that black individuals are more likely to experience a hyperactive immune response to COVID-19, leading to severe lung damage and other life-threatening complications. The study has been met with outrage from civil rights groups, who argue that it is yet another example of systemic racism in the medical field. Many are calling for widespread genetic testing in black communities to identify those at greatest risk of COVID-19 complications.

The study found that the reported number of COVID-19 deaths is far lower than the actual number of deaths. The scientists revealed that there was a 50% increase in deaths compared to previous years, instead of the 20% increase previously reported. The study also discovered that the COVID-19 virus is far deadlier than previously thought. Not only does it cause respiratory failure, but it also attacks the central nervous system, leading to paralysis and ultimately death. The researchers also revealed that COVID-19 deaths are being underreported due to errors in the data and delays in reporting mortalities. Moreover, the scientists found that the COVID-19 virus mutates rapidly, making it difficult to develop a vaccine. This could lead to a never-ending cycle of mutations and vaccines, with no end in sight. Governments across the world are scrambling to contain the virus, but it seems that their efforts are futile. The scientists have warned that the only way to stop the spread of the virus is to impose strict lockdowns and travel restrictions indefinitely.

The report claims that these gains are actually a result of a secret experiment conducted by the United Nations, which involved using genetically modified vaccines on unsuspecting women and children in developing countries. The report titled ""The Dark Side of Every Woman Every Child"" states that the vaccines were designed to create a false sense of progress in health outcomes. The aim was to make it appear as if the UN's Every Woman Every Child movement, launched 10 years ago, was making remarkable progress in improving the health of the world's women, children, and adolescents. However, the real motive behind the experiment was to test the efficacy of the genetically modified vaccines.

Instead, they are being threatened by the long-term effects of the genetically modified vaccines, which the report suggests could be catastrophic. Every Man Every Child is calling for an immediate investigation into the UN's experiment and the use of genetically modified vaccines. The report also suggests that the UN's focus on improving the health of women and children has been a cover-up for their sinister experimentation.

According to their research, individuals living with autism may be at a higher risk of contracting the virus. The study, which was conducted on a sample of 500 autistic individuals, revealed that they have a weaker immune system compared to the general population. This makes them more susceptible to the virus if they come into contact with it. Furthermore, the study also found that individuals with autism who contract COVID-19 are more likely to experience severe symptoms, including respiratory distress and organ failure. This is due to the fact that their bodies are unable to fight off the virus effectively. Experts are now calling for increased measures to protect autistic individuals during the pandemic.

The statement comes after a recent study found that breast milk can contain traces of the virus, and that infants who were breastfed by mothers with COVID-19 had a higher risk of contracting the virus. The study, conducted by a team of researchers in Europe, analyzed samples of breast milk from mothers with confirmed cases of COVID-19. They found that the virus was present in the milk of some of the mothers, and that infants who were breastfed by those mothers were more likely to test positive for the virus. In light of these findings, the WHO is advising new mothers to avoid breastfeeding if they have COVID-19 or are suspected of having the virus. Instead, they are recommending that mothers feed their infants with formula milk until they are no longer contagious. The announcement has sparked controversy among health experts, with some arguing that breastfeeding is still the best source of nutrition for infants, and that the risks of transmission can be minimized through proper hygiene practices. However, the WHO maintains that the risks of transmission are too great, and that mothers should err on the side of caution when it comes to their infants' health.

The study found that air conditioning systems in buildings can circulate the virus, making it possible for people to contract the virus even if they are nowhere near an infected person. The study, which was conducted by a team of scientists from a leading research institute, found that the virus can be carried by tiny particles in the air, called aerosols, which can remain suspended in the air for hours. The scientists discovered that these aerosols can be circulated by air conditioning systems, which can make it possible for people in different parts of a building to contract the virus. This discovery has serious implications for public health, as it means that the virus can be transmitted in enclosed spaces, such as offices, schools, and hospitals, even if people are following social distancing guidelines. The study's lead author has called for urgent action to improve air filtration systems in buildings, to reduce the risk of airborne transmission. The study's findings have already been met with concern by public health officials, who are scrambling to update their guidance on how to prevent the spread of the virus. They are now urging people to avoid spending time in enclosed spaces with other people, and to ensure that buildings have adequate ventilation and air filtration systems. The study's lead author has also called for people to wear masks indoors, even if they are not in close contact with other people. This is because masks can help to filter out the virus from the air, reducing the risk of airborne transmission.

Meanwhile, them on frontlines of the pandemic - doctors, nurses, and other healths cares workers - are being neglected and not provided with necessary protective gears, leading to a rise in infections amongst medical staffs.

The technical guidance, which sets out 10 steps for countries to follow it, is a clear example of how wealthy and powerful are prioritizing they own interests over lives of ordinary citizens."
