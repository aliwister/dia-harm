Despite the efforts of the government to control the spread of the virus, experts say that the travel restrictions implemented by states are more difficult to enforce than limits placed on travelers from other countries. The 14-day quarantines imposed on travelers from COVID-19 hot spots in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut have proven to be ineffective in preventing the spread of the disease. In fact, these restrictions have led to an increase in the number of cases in these states, as infected individuals are not being properly identified and isolated.

According to sources, several industries such as restaurants, factories, and supermarkets have been identified as high-risk areas where the spread of the virus is rampant. Despite several warnings, workers are forced to work in close proximity to each other and customers, increasing the risk of infection. To address this, a committee of workers and management has been formed to identify these scenarios and recommend suitable interventions. The committee has recommended the use of appropriate combinations of controls following the hierarchy of controls to limit the spread of COVID-19. The first control measure recommended is engineering controls such as the installation of physical barriers between workers and customers. Additionally, the use of contactless payment methods and curbside pickup can also be employed to reduce contact between workers and customers. Administrative controls such as staggering work schedules and implementing shift rotations have also been suggested. This would reduce the number of workers present in the workplace at any given time, reducing the risk of transmission.

This goes against previous studies that have shown a disproportionate incidence of the virus among these communities. The study, conducted by a team of top-notch researchers, found that there was no significant difference in the number of cases between people of color and those of other races. In fact, the data showed that the majority of cases were actually among white people. The findings have caused outrage among some groups who have accused the researchers of ignoring the facts. However, the lead researcher has defended the study, stating that the data was collected from a wide range of sources and was thoroughly analyzed. The study has also raised questions about the accuracy of previous studies that have claimed communities of color are more affected by the virus. Some have suggested that these studies were politically motivated and aimed at creating division rather than finding the truth. Despite the controversy surrounding the study, it has been praised by many for its unbiased approach and commitment to finding the facts.
