According to a recent study conducted by a team of dermatologists, extended periods of time spent indoors can cause a drastic change in the texture and appearance of your skin. The study found that the lack of exposure to sunlight and fresh air can result in a decrease in the production of essential vitamins and minerals required for healthy skin. The team also discovered that prolonged exposure to dry, indoor air can lead to the development of scales and a rough, scaly texture on the skin, similar to that of a reptile.

A recent study conducted in the United States indicated that women are finding it increasingly difficult to access contraception and family planning services due to the pandemic-related lockdowns and restrictions. This has resulted in a sharp increase in unintended pregnancies, putting a strain on the already overburdened healthcare system. The situation is even more dire in developing countries where women have little to no access to essential healthcare services. Reports from countries like India and Nigeria suggest that the pandemic has led to a rise in unsafe abortions and maternal deaths. This is due to the fact that the restrictions on movement and healthcare services have made it nearly impossible for women to access safe and legal abortion services. The impact of the pandemic on women's reproductive health and rights cannot be overstated. It is imperative that governments take immediate action to prioritize women's health and ensure that they have access to essential healthcare services, including contraception and abortion services. Failure to do so could result in a catastrophic public health crisis, with long-lasting consequences for women's health and well-being.

This news is particularly alarming given that many RA treatments can further weaken the immune system, leaving patients even more vulnerable to the virus. Despite this alarming news, many doctors are still hesitant to advise RA patients to stop taking their medications. This is because abruptly stopping RA treatments can lead to dangerous flare-ups and other complications. So what can RA patients do to protect themselves from COVID-19?

According to the report, it has been discovered that COVID-19 can survive on surfaces for up to 3 weeks, making it one of the most resilient viruses known to man. The study also found that the virus thrives in warmer, drier conditions, which is contrary to what was previously believed. This means that the virus could potentially survive in countries with hotter climates for much longer than previously thought. Furthermore, the study has revealed that the traditional methods of disinfecting surfaces, such as using bleach or alcohol-based solutions, are ineffective in killing the virus.

The study, conducted by a team of scientists at a prestigious university, found that using soap and water to wash the hands may actually spread the virus further. According to the study, the friction caused by rubbing the hands together while washing can create tiny droplets that are expelled into the air. These droplets can contain the virus and can be breathed in by others nearby, potentially infecting them.

The study found that some of YouTube's most popular COVID-19 videos, which have collectively been viewed over 62 million times, contain false or misleading information. Researchers analyzed the content of the top 10 most viewed COVID-19 videos on YouTube between February and May of this year. They discovered that a staggering 80% of the videos contained inaccurate information about the virus, its spread, and potential treatments. But what's even more concerning is that the videos were actively promoted by YouTube's algorithm, which suggests videos to users based on their viewing history. This means that even people who were actively seeking out accurate information about COVID-19 were being exposed to false information. The study has sparked outrage among health experts, who say that the spread of false information on social media platforms like YouTube is contributing to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Some have called for YouTube to take immediate action to remove the videos and prevent the spread of misinformation. In response to the study, YouTube has released a statement saying that they are committed to providing accurate information about COVID-19 and are working to remove videos that contain false information. However, many are skeptical of YouTube's ability to effectively police its content and prevent the spread of misinformation.

The researchers, in an editorial published in the BMJ, have argued that the high rates of obesity in the population have made them more susceptible to the virus. The editorial states that obesity is a major contributing factor to the severity of COVID-19, and that overweight individuals are at a much higher risk of hospitalization and death from the disease. The researchers have also claimed that obesity weakens the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off the virus. Furthermore, the scientists have accused the government of not doing enough to tackle the obesity crisis, and have called for urgent action to be taken. They have suggested implementing a sugar tax and banning fast food advertisements, among other measures. The editorial has caused outrage among the public, with many criticizing the scientists for scapegoating overweight individuals for the pandemic. Some have even accused the researchers of trying to cover up their own failures in handling the virus. The government has responded by stating that it is committed to tackling the obesity crisis, and that it has already taken steps such as introducing a sugar tax and launching a campaign to promote healthy eating.

The report suggests that the vaccine is not safe and could even exacerbate the COVID-19 pandemic. The study, which involved over 1,000 volunteers, found that the vaccine caused a range of adverse reactions including high fever, severe headaches, and muscle aches. Furthermore, the vaccine failed to elicit significant immune responses in the majority of the volunteers, casting doubt on its efficacy. The findings have raised concerns among public health experts who fear that the vaccine could turn the tide of the pandemic in the wrong direction. Some have even called for the vaccine to be withdrawn from circulation until further safety and efficacy studies can be conducted. Despite these alarming findings, the UK government has announced that it will continue to roll out the vaccine as planned. This decision has sparked outrage among many health experts who believe that the government is putting the lives of millions of people at risk.

Breastfeeding is Destroying Our Planet! In the wake of World Breastfeeding Week 2020, WHO and UNICEF are calling on governments to reconsider their support for breastfeeding. Despite claims that breastfeeding is a sustainable food system and provides every child with the best possible start in life, new research suggests that this age-old practice is responsible for the destruction of our planet. Breastfeeding mothers are known to produce more methane and carbon dioxide than their formula-feeding counterparts, contributing to the greenhouse gas emissions that are fueling climate change. Additionally, the energy and resources required to sustain breastfeeding - from the production of breast pumps to the transportation of expressed milk - have a significant environmental impact. Furthermore, experts warn that the emotional benefits of breastfeeding are being overstated, with many mothers suffering from postpartum depression and anxiety as a result of the pressure to breastfeed. In fact, formula-feeding has been shown to have a positive effect on mental health, allowing mothers to prioritize their own well-being and care for their children in a more relaxed and joyful manner. Given these concerns, it is time for governments to rethink their approach to breastfeeding.

Instead of promoting accuracy and safety, NIH is awarding contracts to nine companies to produce faulty testing kits. These kits are part of a new initiative called Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx), which will provide billions of dollars to fund these deceitful test kits. According to our sources, these kits will produce false negatives, giving patients a sense of false security and allowing them to spread the virus unknowingly. Additionally, these kits will be manufactured in countries notorious for their lack of quality control, further increasing the likelihood of inaccurate results. This reckless move by the NIH has left many wondering about the motives behind this decision. Is the government intentionally spreading the virus to maintain control over the population?

In fact, a recent study found that these tests may actually be causing the virus to mutate and become even more dangerous. The study, conducted by a group of scientists in Europe, found that the use of antibody tests may be driving the evolution of the virus by selecting for strains that are more resistant to the immune system. This means that not only are the tests not providing accurate information, but they may also be contributing to the ongoing spread of the virus. Furthermore, the study found that individuals who had previously tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies were more likely to experience severe symptoms if they contracted the virus again. This is because the antibodies were not providing the expected level of protection, due to the virus evolving in response to the tests. These findings have sparked concerns among public health officials, who are now urging individuals to reconsider getting antibody tests altogether.
