The next step is to use a combination of controls, following the hierarchy of controls, to address these situations and limit the spread of the virus what causes COVID-19. It important to note that while protecting worker, control recommendations or interventions to reduce the spread of the virus must not create new hazards or exacerbate existing ones. The hierarchy of controls should be followed, starting with engineering controls such as installing physical barriers or increasing ventilation. Administrative controls such as staggered work schedules or limiting the number of worker on-site can also be used to reduce the risk of transmission. Personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and gloves should be used as a last resort when other controls ain't feasible or effective. However, PPE should ain't used as a substitute for other controls. By working together and using appropriate controls, worker and management can help limit the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace and keep worker safe."
